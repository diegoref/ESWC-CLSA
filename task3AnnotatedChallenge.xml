## Topic: An Excellent Resource.
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I have been a member of e-groups for a couple of years now.  
The way I became a member was through a friend.  
I and a few friends of mine were involved in a little email circle of our own and my friend who knew about e-groups figured it would be easier if we joined e-groups.  
This way if we were going on vacation we could unsub from our group email and not be bogged down with email's when we returned.  
After our email ring was formed was when I delved a little deeper into e-groups and took a look around.  
I was completely amazed with all the groups they had to offer.  
There is something for everyone on egroups and after venturing around I joined a few more email lists and have formed a lot of great friendships over the past two years.


E-groups is a wonderful way to meet people who share your interests, to get support for a common problem or illness or to talk about hobbies, careers, current events, sports, family, etc....  
There is a community for everyone at e-groups and if you can't find one you can always start your own.


I have been very happy with e-groups and have never had any problems other than there routine maintenance where they have to take their site down for a few hours.  
I have heard of people having problems receiving email out of order or not receiving some of there messages at all.  
Personally, I think this probably has to do with the individuals internet service provider.


I highly recommend e-groups, I think they are the largest email based community provider out there.  
Yahoo has there own version but I am very happy with e-groups and the realtionships I have formed so I will stay there.  
I can't recommend e-groups highly enough.  
Best of all, It's free!

		I'm midway through a PhD in organization and management at Capella. 
To this point, the instructors have been engaged, providing significant feedback, and well qualified. 
My fellow learners are intelligent, hardworking, and have plenty of real-world experience to share. 
I am finding the experience very worthwhile and rigorous.

		Veterans Beware!!!

U of P does not work well with the GI Bill. 
first, it took almost a year for me to start getting payments from the VA because the VA rep at the school kept "losing" my paperwork. 
i eventually had to send it myself by certified mail. 
and, because of the 5-week class schedule (6 for masters), the payments are not regular. 
at traditional schools, you get a set amount each month you are enrolled. 
at Phoenix, you do not receive your VA payments until after the end of each class, and it is pro-rated for the month, so you only get a partial payment, based on the time of the month you complete the class.

overall, the classes provide good information. 
as a program designed for working adults, there is sometimes a lot of homework, and the instructors are hit-and-miss as far as quality of instruction.

my biggest issue is with the school's relationship with the VA. this has been major problem since I started, almost 2 years ago. 
Veterans should stay away from Phoenix, as they will not receive the full benefit of the GI Bill. 
while the VA says that it will pay up to $39k of my tuition, it will only actually pay a set amount each month, for as long as i am enrolled. 
that amount is less than the cost of my classes, so in the end i will end up paying close to $3,000 out of pocket for my education. 
the University already has an arrangement with the VA for verifying student enrollment; they should also make it possible for students to get the full benefit of their GI Bill, and not be left paying thousands of dollars out of pocket.

## Topic: The worst customer service you can ever get! 

## Score: 1.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            We have accounts with Charles Schwab, Datek, and Etrade. 
Etrade is the worst! 
We are seriously thinking to close our accounts with them. 
Honestly, Etrade has the greatest interface--so you never need to keep records of your transactions and everything is on line. 
(However, it?
s very slow when you place an order to purchase stocks on line) But we always have problems with their customer service and they also made a lot of mistakes. 
When we get married, we merged two accounts together and they just put my stock into my husband?
s account without my name and without the correct purchase price. 
Every time you call, they will tell you to do this or that and next time they told you different things. 
We finally just gave up on correcting it after phone calls and phone calls. 
They have the wrong base for my husband?
s option excise price too. 
We even had problems to close our money market. 
I made almost 10 calls to close the money market tonight ( Jan. 19, 2005 from 9:00 EST ) and the customer service reps just kept transferring me ( and put me on hold forever) and lying about how long you have to wait because of tax season ( Are you joking? 
Mid Jan?) 
and they don't have access to your account ( Later on, they have access when you finally got upset enough and it's the same people that you just spoke to) and you have the wrong address ( even you only confirm the address with other reps 2 mins ago). 
We have sizable amount in our Etrade account and this is the way we got treated. 
So be careful what you got from them. 
Oh, BTW, don't trust their ads about $50 free when you open account with them. 
We never got ours. 
Not only that--they got your high interest rate for few months and then drop it from 2 something to 1.01% after few months. 
I probably should not tell such a truth because I own the Etrade stock. 
But if I was their customer before I bought the stock, I will never purchase them. 
Of course, the stock has lost 60% of value. 
You know why if you ever have any experience with their customer service.

		All I received was a high pressure sales job, and trust me, I know what a hig pressure sales job is, I used to write the scripts for them.

I told my "advisor" that I was doing research on online education and 30 minutes later he gave me a deadline. 
The next day he called me and started to chew me out for missing the deadline???? 
What's up with that? 
For the next 3 days, his "supervisor" called me and tried to embarrass me into sending him an application fee since they had done so much work on my behalf to get me enrolled. 
He insisted that i owed at least that to them. 
I told him to sue me for it.

		I would just like to say that I am just now enrolling to the UoP and I am most excited. 
I am a single mother that works full time. 
I have a degree in Aerospace Engineering and I must say, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that school (ANY school) is what you make of it. 
I received my bachelor's from Georgia Tech, which is ranked 2nd in the country for my undergraduate degree. 
But with it's high rank and notable reputation, the students there are miserable and terribly unhappy. 
Many are even deterred from their field by the experiences they had at the school. 
However, I can say that though my experience was not always what I wanted, I made the best out of it. 
There were students who cheated their way through GT and swore that was the only way to survive it. 
There were students who received A's in classes that they didn't learn a single thing in, but flunked classes they learned the most in. 
I personally never cheated and I made a personal effort to learn in every class, no matter what. 
You can only get out what you put in. 
To me, what made my experience at GT so difficult is that it is not geared in any fashion for the non-traditional student. 
It was hard for me to work the amount of hours that I needed to work to support myself and my child AND go to class, which were only offered during the daytime. 
Though I have not taken a class with UoP, I have rated it a 5 star because I think it's providing students like myself with a great opportunity to further their education without compromising their careers or family lives. 
I am going into the education field, and I am grateful for the UoP for offering a program that will allow me to teach, raise my child, AND get a Masters. 
Can't beat that!

		I'm just starting at DeVry Online in WA state. 
I've had a great experience so far. 
I really like that my advisor ACTUALLY CARES about my success and always keeps me up to date, and even calls occasionally to check in and make sure I'm still on track. 
My Community College credits transferred just fine, I entered DeVry as a high sophomore. 
The financial aid office has been extremely helpful.

Here is some REAL ADVISE: Those of you who say DeVry's support staff don't do their job need to take more initiative on your own because nobody will do it for you, even at a traditional state school. 
Whether you need help with $$, tutoring, job placement... there is only so much that someone else can do for you and the rest you must do on your own or not at all. 
This fault, if you have it, will follow you throughout your professional career as well; I think that is why some grads can't find jobs, they rely on job placement services too heavily. 
Don't blame your problems on someone else because they are just that - YOUR problems.

A word of caution to High School students: I am an adult student, I already have 5+ years of experience in my field and I only went back to school because I know for a fact I will be promoted to management when I get my degree; I've discussed this path with my bosses and they are all onboard and none seem sceptical about the quality of education at DeVry. 
If I was just out of high school I would not choose DeVry because I look at this school as a good place to CONTINUE my education. 
If I was just out of high school, I would look to a more traditional school for higher education because with a bare resume, you want the best, most recognized school possible.

I chose DeVry because I work 40-50 hours per week and I can't attend classes in person (there's not enough time in the day!), and they also offer a degree that is very specific to my field. 
The price was a little shocking, but considering my program is accelerated the cost is not as much as you'd think, less time = less money. 
This is the right fit for me, but do your homework because it might not be for you!

		I've just started CTU a year ago and I was appalled at what I've been reading. 
It's bad enough that we go through all sort of obstacles in life, now I see people downing my school. 
I love CTU and it has to have thousands of people joining for a reason everyone isn't dumb. 
It's a for profit university and of course it will have sales or account executives...duh! 
I have yet to experience all the bull that you are claiming to have went through. 
Lightened up, if you use to work there move on get another job and God will bless you.

		Anybody who thinks UoP is a degree mill simply doesnt know what he or she is talking about. 
Those that complain the most are often people who attended other b-schools and think graduates from UoP are slackers and somehow lowering standards overall. 
Uop is not Harvard, and none of us think that, but we also work very, very hard for what were earning. 
The whole for profit thing is a red herring. 
All schools are out to make a profit and none of them can operate without income. 
I have finished 11 of my 15 MBA classes at UoP and I have a 3.85 GPA. 
Although I know there are many other schools with stellar reputations and much higher standards, my life stage dictated that I attend a school that could cater to my work hours and pressures. 
I would have never been able to get a grad degree while the sole breadwinner and co-parent to four kids. 
Combine that with the fact that I am in my early forties and the possibilities for continuing education were very limited. 
My job would never have allowed for me to take daytime hours to get an MBA and night classes are not available anywhere near where I live. 
I wish I could have gone a different route but I could never pass the GMAT without extensive tutoring. 
Also, after reviewing the substance of the GMAT, I realized that it would never measure ANY skills needed for my career. 
As it stands, more and more respectable b-schools are dropping the GMAT requirement because theyre coming to the same conclusion I did, specifically, that the GMAT is a very poor indicator of who will be a good grad school student. 
Pre-tests like SATs and GMATs are designed to be more exclusive than much else. 
They dont measure a persons intellect, only what they may or may not have learned up to that point, but never what they are capable of learning down the road. 
My SATs scores were very average but during my undergrad years, I went on to be a Phi Beta Kappa candidate, sit on the deans list multiple times, and get a BFA with honors from one of the most prestigious design schools in the world. 
The curriculum there is affectionately referred to as medical school without the blood. 
It makes top-notch b-schools look easy because there were no correct answers, only subjective opinions about students work. 
I know tough, and UoP asks for plenty from its students.

		The constant negative controversy surrounding Capella and other institutions of this type is deserved. 
They are not really "non traditional" excellent institutions as much as they are advertising savvy businesses. 
They seek out and use four types of students: 1) students who are not very adept at finding good institutions, 2) students who doubt their own abilities, 3) student who cannot overcome the psychological barrier of being outside of perceived mainstream systems, and students who want a simple way out of the challenge of good competitive educational excellence. 
These people are great sitting ducks for trashy institutions like Capella that are really all about misuse of government loan funding. 
When Cappella's low rent degrees are exposed to hiring entities aware of good education practices, they do not hire these so called degreed graduates. 
I recently was involved in a conversation at work where a Capella PH D student was so ashamed of the school for his "in progress" degree that he did not want to mention the name of the institution to the group. 
When they, in error, thought he was at the University of Arizona and were impressed, he just let them think that, turned red, and left the conversation as soon as possible. 
Knowing that he was in the Cappella program and then seeing his embarrassment said volumes. 
There are many mainstream online classes through good universities. 
Capella is a disgrace and people who enroll there are fooling themselves. 
There are always lucky people who will get ahead with any degree. 
Capella is a junk degree sold to a disenfranchised group who are looking for a Ph D in all the wrong places. 
PhD's from Capella are the equivalent of a medical degree from a Wal-Mart pharmacy. 
People who have PH D's from Capella are academic QUACKS...and perceived as such by people who know higher education.

## Topic: $100 Bonus Offer Great, But Read The Fine Print
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I opened an E*TRADE account a few months ago during their promotion where they offered a $75 bonus just for opening an account.  
The current $100 is a fantastic opportunity to make some free money, but make sure you read the fine print first.  
If you look closely at the details of the offer, you'll notice that you must keep your account open for 6 months, so don't think that you can take your money and run.


If are not into trading individual stocks, as I am not, you can still take advantage of this opportunity.  
Did you know that you can also buy mutual funds through E*TRADE.  
In fact, E*TRADE itself administers a few funds, including a Bond Market Index and an S and P 500 Index.  
These are two of the cheapest mutual funds available to the E*TRADE investor, but are among other no- of low-load funds.  
However, looking at the fine print, you'll notice a fee of around $20 for selling your mutual fund within 3 months.  
So to make this offer work for you, you should be willing to have your money "locked-up" for a few months.  
And be careful to read about other mutual fund expenses and quarterly fees before committing your money to them for three months.


As far as E*TRADE itself, I have always been pleased with my time at their website.  
I've never had any problems or delays logging on, although I only check my accounts once or twice a week.  
I did notice that E*TRADE does not supply you with postage paid envelopes to send in deposits like Vanguard does.


In summary, take advantage of the $100 E*TRADE offer by the end of the year, but read the fine print first.  
I'd suggest the following strategy?
Send in the minimum initial deposit ($1000) to open a cash account.  
Put the money into one of the E*TRADE index funds.  
Receive your $100 bonus.  
Let everything sit for 6 months and then decide what to do from there.  
In 6 months, you will have gained $100 plus gains on your mutual fund and you can choose to continue investing with E*TRADE, or pull your money out and invest with a better firm, such as Vanguard.

		CONS: Many of you have had problems with the financial aid. 
I too originally thought it was supposed to be some kind of grant (the Pell grant I think it was?) until Apollo sent me a loan balance, which I never approved. 
I quickly put an end to that crap and started my GI Bill. 
I also had a problem with a biology teacher. 
The problem was eventually corrected, but it pissed me off. 
I also discovered it's difficult to find the proper channel to make a complaint against a teacher. 
And of course, there is the issue with the intelligence of your peers. 
I have generally found that of a class of about 30, only 4 or 5 people will have a firm grasp of the English language which hasn't been a problem for me so far. 
Last but not least, I don't participate in forum discussion. 
This hurts my grade slightly, but I read enough illiterate material at my job. 
I fear that interacting with these people will bring me down. 
PROS: As many on this site have stated, you can get an education from this place if YOU HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE. 
Yes, that means you actually have to read the course material and avoid BSing your way through the classes. 
I personally save ALL my course material for later review. 
After all, I paid for it. 
Aside from the one biology teacher, I've had nothing but stout cooperation from most of my teachers. 
They've always been willing to answer my questions (or direct me to the proper forum), and I think they've given me fair grades. 
I can't speak for other students' grades, as I have not seen them. 
I generally find the work and reading to be moderately challenging, and enjoy doing most of it. 
I will at the very least get my associates degree from UoP. 
I can't vouch for the degree's clout in the real world, but I'll soon find out BEFORE pursuing my bachelors (I'll get back to you on that). 
Without the flexible schedule, there is no way in hell I would be getting my degree right now. 
I have rent, insurance, and other expenses to pay which require a JOB. 
Unfortunately, online education is the only way I can reach my goals. 
To those of you enrolled, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. 
For those of you who have had bad experiences, I hope you find a college that suits your needs.

		I graduated from Devry, and my two cents about it. 
I work in the field as a software engineer; graduated in 2004 and have been employed since. 
Likes: - On hands training ( a lot of lab work ) - Some very knowledgeable experts were my professors ( this matters because you learn best from those who have real world knowledge, and not just from an individual with a masters or phd and no real world experience; and yes more of my professors had obtained their phds ) - very good guidance and counseling on what courses will be required and what courses mesh well with certain other courses taken during the semester Dislikes: - expensive as hell, at least for a tech school - the university has more of a business approach; rather, than a campus to serve the students approach - too many units in one semester ( if you are on the accelerated program ) - you don't get the same atmosphere as other universities ie. parties, sports teams, or hot chicks ( lets face it hot girls don't want to become engineers ) From my experience during my attendance at DeVry, I noticed only two types of students; those who want a piece of paper that states they are engineers, and those who actually strive at becoming engineers because they know their future livelihood will depend on it. 
Therefore, if you are the sooner rather than the latter then go to a JC and save yourself a lot of money. 
Also, you can tell which students just wanted a hand me down diploma; because they would always drop out during their later semesters and the lucky ones who managed cheated their way through. 
p.s. I didn't cheat :) my 3.2 gpa is proof of that, not too good and not too bad

## Topic: Stay away from E-Trade...
## Score: 1.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            E-Trade service is really bad read for yourself.
1) Phoned Sunday, 12_04_2005 (45 minutes hold time), to close one of my E-Trade accounts and move the content (less then $2000) to my E-Trade IRA account.

I was told it would be done the same day and would be visible on Monday morning.

2) Monday morning the operation is still not visible. 
Phone (20 minutes hold time) to ask why. 
I'm told by Ziishan  (ext 3171) that it took a little longer and should be done by the next morning at the latest.

3) Tuesday morning still not done. 
Phone (10 minutes hold time) again, this time I speak with Levar (ext: 4453).

I explain what I want and tell him about the previous 2 calls. 
He tells me it should be done soon. 
I ask "When will it be done?"
, he responds "Well it's initiated now". 
So I insisted he gives me a "done target date". 
Put me on hold again (for minutes at a time). 
This time he comes back and says "You can not transfer the securities into your IRA". 
So now after insisting for a "done date" I got a "never will happen condition". 
At this point I do not trust what this man is saying since he appear to have been trying to just get me to  end the call (his last word were "the transfer is initiated"....). 
I ask to speak to a manager, to get this done. 

I get Rene (ext 4453). 
After describing the situation to Rene, I proceed to try to understand the structure of the "customer service department". 
I learn that she is really an "acting" team lead, the real team lead is Chris Dodson which himself reports to Connie Forster. 
Anyway after making her verify (since IRAs are not her expertise) she confirm that I must sell my stock and then transfer the cash to my E-Trade IRA. 
I get online sell my stock at market and tell her "ok now my account is all cash, when can you close this account and transfer it's content to my other E-Trade account?". 
She says that they now have to wait 3 days for the "stock sell" to clear and then, they will finally complete the transfer and close the account. 
According to her this time, it should be done by next Monday. 
I hope it will be.


Conclusion E-Trade customer service sucks big time. 
By the way the reason I'm closing one of my E-Trade accounts is that they were charging a $40/maintenance fee per quarter, $160/year since years. 
They "double suck", stay away from E-Trade...it's a matter of weeks before I close my last E-Trade account. 
E-Trade is going down...leave the boat while you can. 
By the way I've been a customer of E-Trade since around 1995.


---Update Monday ------
Still not done. 
Phoned E-Trade support (20 minutes hold time) got Denis (ext 4312). 
I told her what I was trying to do and the events since last Sunday (she was the fifth rep. 
I spoke to about this issue...). 
She said that she escaladed the request. 
After another 5 minutes hold time, she told me it should be done within 3 business days, so by Thursday morning (at the latest) it should be done...
-----------------------

What does this mean to you the prospective customer of E-Trade. 
Do not use ETrade, most good reviews about E-Trade are years old (they were the best in the 90s). 
There support reps (probably outsourced?) 
are deeply incompetent, they could as well be doing the support for "SirSpeedy". 
The Etrade web site is nice, but you will need, one day or another, help with a live E-Trade rep (for example to close your account). 
Plus a company that is not ran right (wasting their customers patience and their own reps $time$, for such a relatively simple issue) will tend to go under more easily. 
Make sure you understand what will happen to your money if Etrade goes under.

		It seems to me that there is a very large margin of opinion about CTU. 
I would think that it is hard to manage a school with so many students all over the world. 
I had both great and horrible experiences while attending. 
I am currently deciding if I should continue my BSBA or find another school. 
The biggest problem I had was dealing with the professors that I could not understand at all. 
Their accent was so thick, I didn't know what they were saying half the time. 
If you don't pick up the book and use it then the professors can usually tell. 
Trying to slip by with out actually doing the work may help get you by, but not with a decent grade. 
I had some issue with a professor not even grading the work we turned in. 
Every thing was a scam and they did email us to let us know. 
They gave me a passing grade and called it good, and that is a big red flag. 
After that I withdrew, but I did have some great experiences with many professors also. 
In all, I would say that I had an equally good and bad time attending. 
I do believe that majority of the time you get what you put into the degree. 
Most companies are not going to outsource to someone who has never worked for them and has no idea how they operate from within to be the manager over everyone. 
You should start from the bottom like everyone else does, and get your degree to keep ahead.

		UOP is the worst school that I have ever attended!! 
Not so much the class structure, but the staff are horrible. 
I couldn't get in touch with my financial counselor for weeks. 
After threatening to withdraw she finally contacted me. 
On top of that she didn't process my current student deferment, so one of my loans went to collections!! While trying to get things smoothed over, the manager called and was worse than the counselor herself. 
The manager was rude, snappy, and cut me off in mid-sentence. 
Now because of all of the trouble I have had since starting, I am $1600 in debt. 
I will turn everyone I can away from this school.

		I would like to say that University of Phoenix is one of the best online programs out there. 
I work at a hospital, and it is hard to get to a traditional classroom. 
I soon found that almost half of my wing got their bachelors from this school. 
The counselors are wonderful, the faculty overall was good, and very flexible. 
What I do not understand is all the negative feedback. 
I would bet that most of the negative people did not make it through a class or two. 
The bottom line is that school is hard, and if you are not willing to do the work, it will be very frustrating. 
Own up to your own inabilities, but do not blame the biggest Univ. in the country for not being good at what they do. 
If they are so expensive, and not good, why are they the largest school in the U.S. Word would get out in the past 15 years they have been doing it. 
I would like to encourage those that are serious about their education to look at University of Phoenix!!!

## Topic: E*Trade isn't perfect, but it's cheap
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I deal purely with corporate stock issues, and I have mixed emotions about dealing with E*Trade. 
Their website contains a lot of information which can really help with deciding just when to pull the trigger on that big trade. 
At the same time, when you actually DO pull the trigger, it sometimes takes the bullet a couple of minutes to leave the chamber, if you follow me.


Pros:

For basic trading, the website is set up so that it is very easy to navigate. 
Most people will be able to figure out their way around the first time at the site, which can not be said for, I think, the majority of websites.


It's cheap. 
At $14.95 for NYSE trades, and $19.95 for Nasdaq and limit trades, I believe Ameritrade and MyDiscountBroker.com are the only online brokers that are actually cheaper.


If you have accounts at E*Trade Bank, you can link your brokerage, checking, and savings accounts so that money can be transferred back and forth. 
I love this feature because it eliminates having to wait 3-5 days for my checks to get clear across the country and into my accounts. 
It also eliminates the wire transfer fees you would incur if you were in a bit more of a hurry.


There is a lot of helpful free information at your fingertips. 
Some of it can be found for free at places like Yahoo! 
Finance and CNBC's website, such as company profiles, financial information, news, and Zack's consensus reports. 
The extra you get at E*Trade is Standard  and  Poor's stock reports, tracking of insider and institutional trading, and very useful technical analysis from clearstation.com.


Cons:

The site is either down, unuseably slow, or has a glitch on a far too frequent basis.


I can recall at least 5 days in the past year that I was so utterly unable to log in to my account that I simply gave up. 
Thankfully none of those days coincided with important trades.


Because of site delays, trades you WANT to make can take up to 5 minutes to actually execute. 
This is not to say that the trades arent executed promptly once the order is placed, but that it can take a while to navigate the site, and wait for the correct pages to load.


The free "real time quotes" can sometimes take as long as two minutes to come up on screen, and on occasion, although this is rare, have been as much as 5 minutes old.


Account information updating is often being delayed due to some site updating, or maintenance, or other website parlance of that sort. 
Today, for instance, my Account Summary has not been updated for 4 days because of "maintenance" that occurred over the weekend. 
Granted, my account balances can still be accessed, and the number represented is accurate. 
It would be nice, however, if the information concerning my account were a little more consistent throughout the website.


Gripes:

When E*Trade introduced the account linking with E*Trade bank, a software glitch made it impossible to actually accomplish "linkage" the first 3 times I tried. 
Someone else I know, who uses E*Trade, had a similar problem with linking their accounts.


It would be nice if streaming quotes were available to those who make less than 75 trades a year. 
It gets a bit tiresome constantly requesting a single real-time quote over and over for 5-10 minutes when you're trying to get an exact idea of what a stock's momentum is at a given moment.


I work with computers, and I can understand occasional problems with websites, however, E*Trade really SHOULD be faster and more reliable.


Overall Impression:

It's a handy little site. 
It has it's faults, but don't we all? 
It's cheap, it's easy to use. 
If you don't make a lot of trades or deal in more complex securities, it's a good, simple brokerage.

		Well after reading most of the comments here, I will say that I am even more afraid to start "UOP" as everyone here is calling it. 
I don't have any degree's just a high school diploma but have been fortunate enough throuout my work years to have really great jobs with high incomes and still have one of those jobs today. 
But for my own personal reason's I really want to go back to school and receive a degree. 
I've been speaking with this one counselor for several month's now from UOP and he calls me once or twice a week to know if I am still going to enroll in the classes for "Associate of Arts in Business"? 
I tell him yes but inside I am saying ?????? because I have been burned before by a so called "training school" that made several promises for the job market today in the Medical Field with hard work and your diploma/certificate. 
But I got nothing in the end, but smart mouth teacher's, a letter to pay for my own Graduation and a bill to receive my Diploma. 
Thank God I got I already had a great job at Kaiser Permanente Medical Facility, because without my own great attitute, common sense, self motivation and hard work, I dought if that school would have helped me and I just don't want to go through it again. 
Don't get me wrong, I know that some things and places are what you make it but If I am paying for it, I want it to pay off, and not just get the money and run. 
Quick story in regards to the school I went to for that Medical Diploma, while on my job at the Hospital, I decided to tell the school that I needed them to fax over my resume for a position at the Hospital without letting them know I already worked there. 
Because this was one of the schools requirements to help the students find medical positions, well can you believe that the school faxed over 35 resumes of other students and not one was mine. 
Can you believe that? 
and I still owe Citibank student loans today. 
Now who wants to get burned again??

		School is what YOU make it. 
Whether you are online or the physical classroom, you determine what you learn and how you learn. 
Some classes are easy, some are hard. 
Some instructors are tough, some are not. 
This is at any school and I know this from going to so many due to moving with the military. 
UOP is often paid for through employer and I don't think they would pay for something they do not believe in.

            I trade infrequently and have simple needs:

1. 
View account holdings, including uninvested cash
2. 
Trade a stock or mutual fund occasionally
3. 
View my portfolio in Microsoft Money
4. 
Get good customer service when problems arise

In all these areas E*TRADE is a disappointment. 
I've considered moving my accounts but have let inertia get the best of me. 
Here are some specifics:

** View account holdings, including uninvested cash **

I want a simple way to ask "What's in my account?" 
But there seems to be no way to view your account holdings and uninvested cash on one page. 
If you click "Portfolio" you'll see everything except uninvested cash. 
You have to go to a separate "Balances" page for this information. 
I receive one paper statement that tells me what I've got in my account, so why can't I get a comprehensive view on the web?


** Trade a stock or mutual fund occasionally **

This works reasonably well and is inexpensive. 
But I find it confusing that mutual fund purchasing happens in a completely different part of the web site than stock purchasing. 
I'd rather have one link that says "Buy and sell", and then be asked what I want to buy.

** View my portfolio in Microsoft Money **

E*Trade supports downloading your portfolio into Money, Quicken, Investor, etc. 
But they have had countless bugs and they take several weeks to fix them. 
When I've called customer service, they invariably suggest I'm making some type of mistake. 
After I tell them I am THE manager at Microsoft who designed the feature, they STILL refuse to take responsibility.

** Get good customer service when problems arise **

BAD/NO E-MAIL: You can't send them e-mail using your e-mail program. 
I dare you to find the location on their web site for submitting a brief message, and if you find it, you must re-enter your name, account number, e-mail, etc. - information they already have. 
You then get to type your question in a tiny box. 
If they ever mail you a response (25% chance), you can't Reply.


BROKEN PROMISES: Countless times they've told me "We'll look into it and get back to you" but they don't.


CAN'T EASILY GET ON PHONE WITH SUPPORT: You must navigate through an interminable voice response system. 
Eventually you'll reach someone and many times they route you to someone else. 
There is no way to get a direct phone number (or e-mail address) for a customer service rep.

## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I'm a stock market addict...yes, I confess.  
Even a stay at home mom can have a thing for the stock market.  
I've been trading since high school (more years that I need to mention) back when the only option was to call Marv at Royal Securities and place an order (or have daddy do it since I was in the middle of Trig class).


I began online trading upon staying home after quitting the grind as Comptroller for a real estate investment company.  
Up to that point I didn't want to even look into online trading because I assumed (probably correctly) that I'd have a hard time doing any computer work without constantly checking the market.  
Dealing with a company's 401(k) was "fun" enough---didn't need the extra fun in my life.


So now I'm an E*Trade user.  
Well, at least I am technically.  
My money currently sits there, but I've traded with them once in the past 6 months.  
Call me disillusioned.


E*Trade has brand recognition going for it and I jumped on the bandwagon thanks in part to that.  
Although most online brokerages are new, something about the way I saw E*Trade's ads everywhere made it feel somehow "safer", perhaps more established.


But oh the frustration....I normally start with "PROS" but since these aren't coming to mind I'll start with the all-important "CONS"

CONS
* Sing it with me "How slow can you load...how slow can you load...."  
I have a relatively new computer, a fast modem, and I'm waiting far too long between the time I input my password and the time I get to the next screen
.


* In my case it has taken up to 24hours to be able to see an accurate account balance post trade
.


* Email Alerts drive me crazy!!  
(An Email Alert will come on when you have placed a trade of some sort).  
Trying to access them takes forever, and don't even think about trying to completely delete them.  
Ugh!


* "trades starting at $14.95  I think I've had one $14.95 trade in my history of usage.  
Trades fluctuate based on dollar value and the like.  
Call it a sliding scale if you will.  
Some may find this an obvious thing, but I believe a great many people have been surprised to find their trade didn't cost just $14.95

* Unless you trade in high volumes and maintain a high account, don't think that E*Trade is your route to IPO access
.


* The trade screen was not set up for the beginning online trader.  
There are too many options to select from which many novices will not understand.


PROS
* IF you already have some good experience in the stock market and are pretty well versed in the lingo associated with buying and selling, the actually action of placing a trade is relatively simple and easy to execute
.


* Unless you have a very generous broker (or he's your father) your trading expenses will be less than trading the "old fashioned way"

		My experience was similar to surprised's from June of 2007. 
I'm a somewhat embittered former doctoral level Capella learner who earned a 3.76 GPA through my masters with another institution, a 3.933 GPA all through the doctoral coursework with Capella, and who had no problem passing the comps at Capella the first time around.


What was my experience during the dissertation process? 
A lack of oversight from my mentor resulting in many mis-steps and dead ends, months of delays in the development of my proposal because of the same, and a continuously-frustrating lack of "connect" between the guidelines that Capella's School of Human Services provided at the time, and what my committee was even aware of-in the end I withdrew out of frustration.


I will likely always regret withdrawing, and I know I'll regret not earning my doctorate. 
I honestly, though, saw no end to the frustration. 
After it all, and as an educator in a public school district (K-12), I have a very hard time understanding how anyone could be willing to accept anything less than excellence from an institution that charges $50,000+ for an educational program.


If anyone has had a similar experience, please send me an e-mail at searchinglearner@juno.com, I'd be interested in comparing notes.

		It's a shame you don't have negative stars.


I took a single class from Devry years ago, which I paid for at the time. 
Obviously Devry agreed that I'd paid, since they sent me my final grade, and later sent several transcripts out to other institutions.


Five years later, I discovered that Devry had turned my supposedly delinquent account over to some disreputable collections agency. 
When I called Devry, they wouldn't talk to me about it because they'd turned it over. 
The collections jerks weren't interested in anything, including receipts that proved I'd paid. 
I finally had to get an attorney to straighten it out for me.


Of course we all know how disreputable collections companies are, and the kinds of people they routinely hire and use. 
Devry turned my account over with my social security number as the account number, so I've had no choice but to put watches on my information with the credit bureaus and on my individual credit accounts.


It's impossible to tell whether they're thieves or simply incompetent; either way, these are not people you want to do business with.

## Topic: A well-run free mailing list service.
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I had a couple of Internet mailing lists I had been hosting on my former employer's server.  
But since I no longer worked there, they were kind of hinting that I ought to find some other place to move that stuff to... they had been nice enough to let me keep that stuff up for a transition period, but eventually I had to stop freeloading on them.  
I also needed to find new hosts for the various personal websites I had on their server. 


While it's possible my new employer might have let me put that stuff on their server if I asked nicely, I decided I'd rather get all of those things moved somewhere that's independent of my employment situation.  
And though my new job pays much better than my old one, I'm still a cheapskate at heart, so I looked for inexpensive or free services. 
Ultimately, I put my main personal websites on 5bucksamonth.com, which (as the name implies) hosts your website (in your own domain name) for $5/month.  
(A couple of other domains I have are hosted at the free service domainvalet.com, which puts them in an annoying ad frameset, because I'm too cheap even to spend five bucks on those!)


But that didn't take care of the mailing lists.  5bucksamonth has a rudimentary mailing-list service that lets me set up a mail alias that forwards to a list of addresses, but that's inadequate for serious lists; there's no mechanism for users to subscribe or unsubscribe themselves (the site maintainer has to do that by hand), and no system to control who can send to the list (anyone who knows the alias address can send messages to it, including spammers).  
So I looked elsewhere to host the lists.


Fortunately, I found eGroups.  
It's a completely free service that lets you set up mailing lists with many features and options.  
The one drawback is that some brief ads will be inserted into messages on the lists.  
This varies somewhat over time; sometimes the ads are fairly unobtrusive at the bottom of messages, while other times they intrude themselves at the top of messages, making the message look a bit like spam.  
But the ads are always brief, so it's not that much of a nuisance. 
And at least plain-text ads can't do some of the annoying stuff that web ad banners do these days.


Aside from the ads, everything else about eGroups is very good.  
You can quickly and easily set up lists on any topic, and you can choose to include them in eGroups' categorized directory to find more members, or choose to be unlisted if you want a private group.  
You have a number of configuration options to decide how the list will be run: whether anyone can send messages to it immediately or the messages need to be approved by a moderator; whether it's a discussion list open to all or an announcement list that only you can post to; and whether anyone can join, or members must be approved.  
Members of your list get some choices too, like whether to receive the messages individually, in batched daily "digests", or not by e-mail at all (they can read them in the online archives in the eGroups website).


If you get adventurous enough to explore them, there are some other advanced features each list can take advantage of.  
There's a calendar feature you can use to add events related to the topic of the list; for instance, if the list is for fans of a particular singer, you can enter the singer's birthday, the dates of his/her upcoming album and single releases, dates and places of his/her concert tour, times of online fan chat sessions, etc.  
Events can be set up to e-mail reminders to the mailing list.  
There's also a "database" feature I haven't tried yet; perhaps you can put up the singer's discography there or something.


eGroups is now owned by Yahoo, and has been merged with another mailing list service, OneList.  
This is how things are going in general for Internet companies, as with banks; they're all getting gobbled up by one another and merging into a handful of big "engulf-and-devour" conglomerates.  
I'm not sure how happy I am with this situation.  
When these sorts of services start out, they're usually small companies run by individuals with a creative vision, who truly care about doing something new and original and doing it well.  
Once they're part of a huge corporation, though, they're likely to lose their vision and be tinkered with to suit some huge marketing plan of which the formerly-independent outfit is only a tiny part.  
Eventually the service loses its character altogether and becomes merely a conduit to draw traffic into more profitable divisions of the conglomerate, and it might even get dumped altogether if it fails to be sufficiently profitable, or "redesigned" in a way that completely loses the features that made it useful and interesting in the first place.  
But so far, Yahoo doesn't seem to have messed around too much with eGroups, and of the big Internet conglomerates, I have fewer negative feelings for them than I do for Microsoft or AOL, so I guess things could be much worse.


This is a very useful service; I recommend it.  
Just don't get too dependent on it; like any free service, the provider has no obligation to keep providing it forever, so it could get altered or discontinued overnight at the whims of its corporate bosses.  
But enjoy it while it's here.

		I too experienced CTU as an instructor for one and only one semester. 
I thought they were only concerned about making money and not the education. 
I was told by the Dean that there was too many A's in my classes. 
He worried about accreditation. 
So I graded my students much harder and the complaints and threats started.
One student called me at 5:00 am to yell at me about his last grade. 
Another who appeared to be unstable sent me 4 E-mails in the duration of a day with threats and told me what a lousy instructor I was. 
I sent all the messages to the dean, he was absolutely useless and did nothing. 
He kept lying to me about taking care of things and he wanted me back the next semester. 
One night online all of these students ganged up on me about there grades. 
The Dean told me dont let them bully you. 
Students dont usually. 
I teach at 3 other institutions to this day and I am an Associate Dean at another online Institution.
According to the Dean I was scheduled to teach the next round of courses, the classes even appeared in my ID. 
A week before the end of the semester the courses disappeared out of my ID, I figured as much with the amount of students whining about their grades. 
I turned in the final grades and never heard back from them.
I would not want to work for such a two-faced, deceptive organization again. 
All they care about is money, not education. 
I followed the Deans directions and order to teach this course. 
I have never been treated with such disrespect by students. 
For the time, effort, and threats it was not worth it to me.

            I'm writing about an experience with Merrill that has driven me to E-Trade.  
I opened Roth IRA's for my wife and I at Merrill.  
Twenty months later our $12,000.00 investment was only up $733.00 between the two accounts and the market was doing well.  
I felt our money was just stuffed away, with no particular care given to our accounts and not much thought about the index funds in which it was placed.  
I didn't feel the accounts were maintained properly, but hey, I'm just a little fish.


I then found out I can control the stock picks in our Roth IRA's, and YOU CAN CONTROL THE PICKS IN YOURS, TOO!  
I didn't solely have to rely on  Merrill.  
I had my rep close all the index funds and gave him my pick.  
He did the trade for $99.00 x 2 for each account and all he did was execute what I asked, there was no help from Merrill.  
Then he called me at home two days later requesting an additional $242.00 before the settle date because the trade was short.  
I was livid.  
He's the professional, he works numbers for a living!


My next call was to trade out of my positions into new ones.  
I had already far surpassed the $733.00 Merrill had earned me five times over.  
The price for the commissions was different this time...not $99.00, but $130 something, he wasn't quite sure.  
Again, all he was doing was executing what I had researched.  
Even though I had made money, it bothered me.


I lost 7/8 on the next trade on the phone while he fumbled around trying to figure out how much he was going to charge me.  
This time the trades cost $135.00 for each, plus what I lost on the 7/8.  
During the time he was executing the trade, he TOLD me I should move my account to E-Trade for lower commissions.  
NO KIDDING!  
He also mentioned the downside...I wouldn't get his advice.  
I NEVER RECEIVED ANY IN THE FIRST PLACE!  
Mostly because he said Merrill didn't follow any of the stocks I had mentioned.


Also, to trade ANY kind of small stocks, Merrill asks that you trade at least $3,000.00 worth before they'll do the trade.  
E-Trade doesn't care, just pay $14.95 a trade.


I called E-trade where I already have a personal account and asked for transfer papers THAT day.  
I will update you as to how smooth the transfer is.  
I certainly can't afford to wait three months, as did another reviewer here.  
The following review details are for the outstanding E-Trade, not the lackluster Merrill.


***Update...E-trade has been very good to me.  
My trades are executed quickly.  
I can cancel a trade with no problems.  
I have received extra money deposited into my account for being an active trader from E-trade as well as the opportunity to use the Power E-trade system.  
I can choose to receive electronic or paper confirmation of trades and statements.  
I am about to open my E-trade bank account for the higher interest rate, free online bill payment, and free ATM card.

		I'm currently attending the University of Phoenix and will be getting an Associates in Business this winter. 
After reading many reviews I was unsure whether my degree would be worth anything. 
However, I just obtained a well paying job and was asked no questions about my degree.


As for the classes and the quality of the content, I would say they are average. 
You are basically doing home schooling. 
Some instructors are good and some are bad. 
I recently had an instructor in my biology class who was tough. 
I couldn't get away with anything because she was a biology teacher for her local college. 
All the labs for science are virtual as well as the math classes.

I do change academic counselors a lot. 
But, so far that has not affected my education. 
Yes, the time is flexible for classes, but you have to remember there are deadlines for assignments. 
In addition, there is a strict attendance policy. 
Every person has to post at least two time per week to meet attendance or be dropped from the class.


The worst part of the school is the instructors that just hand out A's. 
No matter what I write I get an A. However, I think that even happens in traditional colleges. 
I can recall my health teacher @ Mesa Community college teaching for 15 minutes then dismissing us. 
She also gave us all A's without trying.


I would reccomend the school if you don't have time to go to a traditional school. 
Online education is a blessing for us working adults with children or busy lives.


I know my grammar and writing is rambling but I just wanted to give a quick review to help in any decision making process.

I love the idea of this site, and I used to love the site itself, but lately I've had nothing but bad experiences with MapQuest.
The site is slow, sometimes my maps don't load, and the user interface is far more difficult than it needs to be.
I tend to be a pretty loyal Web site user, so I've continued to go back, but the last three times I was there I had to give up and go over to MapBlast instead.
Now I usually make MapBlast my first stop.
If MapQuest cleans up its act, I'll go back, but until then they've lost a user.

		I attended a traditional college for my BS and tried to continue that with my MS (few years separation there), but with work, wife and kids it became difficult in terms of time driving, taking notes in class, etc. 
Its now been 5 years since I graduated from UoP and I have to say it has help me get promoted. 
Most companies and government job want you to have have a MS degree for management jobs, but as long as they are accredited they hold value. 
My 3 years getting the degree was not easy spending on avg 20 hours per week on discussions, homework, papers and group assignments. 
(Traditional classes you dont get this type of experience). 
You do learn since it forces you to read (and write alot) the textbooks that come with each class and ability to ask questions to your instructor and/or fellow students when you dont understand. 
Iam speaking from experience here and UoP has helped me in my career and you do learn new things. 
Its better than not doing nothing if you continue to go to traditional colleges but never seem to finish because of your business schedule.

		Avoid this institution if you are a Canadian student!!!! 
They know that Revenue Canada will not accept their courses for tax purposes but do not tell that to the students. 
I found out the hard way when trying to collect my tax form after already taking many courses. 
Both my financial advisor and academic advisor knew this but had not told me. 
They are all about the money at UOP. 
The courses were easy and professors quite good, but the support staff is very weak once they have you enrolled.

Mapquest has made going somewhere a much more pleasurable experience.
I always hated writing down directions and noting landmarks.
Invariably, I would leave something out or I would be told to make a right instead of a left.
With Mapquest (and Yahoo Maps which is powered by Mapquest), all you need to do is type in the starting address and the ending address and you are given turn by turn directions.
Sure, there are mistakes sometimes, but you generally end up where you are supposed to and always end up within a short distance of your destination.
Just another way that the Internet has made people's lives easier.

Talking about Mapquest, I wanted to find the new location of my favorite club.
At that time, I new the area considerably good but not enough to find the exact street location.
I didn't want to get lost, so as I followed the exact directions from MapQuest.
I began to realize what a long route MapQuest took me just to get on the freeway.
I went through all these small streets, I was getting so impatient.
Finally I got to Club, so on my way back, I went through my own route.
In my opinion and experience, MapQuest gives good driving directions when you dont know the area/location at all, but not so good when you find all the indirect and long ways to get to your destination.

Great, great service.
I have only had one bad experience with them, which is actually a pretty funny story.
I had a pretty important meeting with a Inktomi in Silicon Valley.
I used Mapquest to get door to door directions, and I left extra early from San Francisco to give myself plenty of time.
I followed the directions perfectly and......
I wound up at some sort of a yacht club or something.
I walked around for a little while asking these cartoonlike yacht guys if this was Inktomi - people of course looked at me like I was crazy.
Fortunately I had left enough time that I was able to call the company and figure out where I was supposed to go.
I found it ironic that an Internet powerhouse such as Inktomi would not be indexed properly on Mapquest...

Well, they generally get me at least close to where I have to be (within a few streets), and I got a few wrong directions (replacing "left" with "right", for example).
But, it's easy to use, very comprehensive, and allows for different types of travel (highway, off-highway, fastest, etc.), and they're printer-friendly.
If traveling somewhere that's very unfamiliar (like another state), it may be advised to keep your eyes open for road names on both the left and right.

They give decent maps..however more often than not, their directions get me lost.
Granted, I am geographically challenged but for whatever reason, it is difficult to follow their directions, I have had better luck with Travelocity.
The search freaks out pretty often too.
I have entered major city names and it comes back with no results one time, and a few minutes later it finds what I am looking for.
In my experience the site has been somewhat unreliable, however, like I said, the maps are detailed and easy to read.

I have never had a bad experience with Mapquest.
I think their directions are detailed and as spot on as can be.
Sometimes you'll put in locations and there will be a mile or so gap from where their directions end and the actual destination but I've only seen that for very out of the way woodsy places.
Otherwise I think this is one of the BEST uses of the web.
What could be better than to have turn by turn directions accessible for FREE, to any where you want to go with miles to travel, time estimated, which roads have tolls etc.
You can't beat it.
They should charge like .20 cents per map or something, I would definitely pay that for each time I use their service.
My only complaint would be that their maps are so small on the print out that you don't really have a visual to reference and I know you can enlarge it but then portions get cut off.
It should automatically assume (or at least give you the ability) that you want to see where your going as well as read it and print it out in a larger format even if they have to spread it out over a couple of sheets.

## Topic: Why E*trade doesn't compare to Waterhouse
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            Currently, I have two trading accounts, one at Waterhouse and the other at E*trade. 
However, after reading all the E*trade fine print and comparing the services, I don't think I'll close my Waterhouse account any time soon.  


I have been a Waterhouse customer for two years.  
In the past year, I have received numerous letters from E*trade each one promised a different bonus for signing up.  
This last time, however, it was a pretty good offer $75 or 6 months free with AOL (for current members only).  
Since AOL normally charges $21.95 per month, I figured E*trade was worth trying if I was getting paid $131.70. 


TRADING COSTS 
- Market trade (buying the stock at the time you place the order) - $14.95
- Limit orders (buying/selling the stock at a certain price) - $19.95
- Stop orders (selling the stock when it drops to a certain price - you are trying to "stop your losses") $19.95
The prices are pretty good compared with other brokerages like Schwab and Fidelity Online Trading, however, Waterhouse cost $12 for any of the above trades.  
Therefore, I don't use this account for trading.


REAL TIME QUOTES - E*Trade charges $14.95 per month for non-professional subscribers.  
Not only are there sites which provide this service for free (thing freerealtime.com) but if you have a Waterhouse account, you get unlimited real time quotes for FREE!


ACCOUNT INFORMATION - The smallest account that you can start at E*trade is $1,000.  
(This is comparable to other investment companies such as Waterhouse that has online trading)

SIGNING UP - Don't sign up without a bonus plan.   
Where the more established companies don't have such benefits, E*trade is constantly running offers, so take advantage of one if you want to sign up.


E*trade also offers a free e-mail address, which I really don't need.  
Therefore, it came down to price.  
E*trade is just too expensive and you don't get anything out the ordinary for your money, just higher commission charges!


Consider Waterhouse if you are looking for an investment company.

		I am a current UoP student in a graduate program. 
I am roughly 4 courses from finishing my 2 year program. 
The promise of the UoP was a great motivator into enrolling at UoP. 
I tried attending a traditional university in the past, for my second degree, and it was too difficult given my work schedule. 
What the UoP offers to career adults, with the promise of flexible education, is great. 
The execution has been less so. 
The deliver technology is good and has gotten better since I started in the program, especially with some of the materials and research resources. 
I have the following issues: 1. Quality of students. 
I had student in my class who could not communicate and had little understanding of English. 
Some students could not understand the material and had such poor spelling and grammar, that I could not believe they were graduate students. 
They also did not work at the level of a graduate student 2. Instructors. 
Some instructors were quite poor, and do not supply lectures or proper feedback on work. 
3. High costs. 
Twice, I have experienced tuition increases. 
Although this happens at traditional universities as well, the program is relatively quite expensive compared to a traditional university, which requires physical facilities. 
4. Poor quality overall. 
Too easy to get an A. You can slide your way to an A with little effort. 
I purposely did not submit work, with the expectation that I would not get an A, only to be surprised. 
Overall, I would not recommend the UoP for anyone at this time, unless the program and way it is managed changes. 
The goals marketed to the public are correct (flexible, adult education), but the corporate goals of the Apollo Group conflict with the goals of an educational institution. 
It is possible to get some knowledge from the program, but this requires the student to read all the materials. 
Otherwise, a student can obtain a high grade with little effort.

		While I'm not a CTU student, I work with four people who are. 
In one case, a coworker is about to graduate with a software engineering degree. 
Not only can he not write a single line of code but, yesterday he asked me what a "text editor" was. 
I have no formal computer related education nor do I consider myself particularly computer literate however, I can answer all of his computer related questions correctly. 
Yet another coworker completed a CTU software engineering masters and has almost no understanding of computers beyond that of a typical computer user. 
How can this school be accredited? 
Even though I work with CTU students, my employer is a federal technical contractor and explicitly does not hire employees with CTU degrees.

## Topic: eCircles.com - groups, clubs, and families neatly organized!

## Score: 4.0

            There are so many clubs and organizations out there on the Web, and they're all begging us to take part in THEIR specialties.  
You've got parenting sites, family sites, shopping sites, sites hosted by search engines, and a whole plethora of other sites out there.


I have found that eCircles.com is the way to end the endless cycle of joining clubs and groups.  
How many different usernames and passwords can one person remember anyway?


eCircles is a place where you can belong to any number of groups or "circles" of people.  
I personally belong to 3 circles right now:  my family circle, a freebies and coupon circle, and a dieting circle.


The way the circles work is, you can join one if invited by a current member.  
Or you can start your own circle by joining eCircles.  
They don't require a whole lot of information to become a member, so it's fairly painless.


Once you are a member, there is so much to do there!  
You can enter as much or as little information as you like.  
You can let certain circles see information, and not others.  
There is a calendar for events.  
There are message boards.  
You can have discussions, make announcements, post pics, have voice or text chats, play games and music, post wish lists, share files, make lists, and post favorite links.


A fun part of eCircles is choosing the character that represents you.  
There are a whole bunch to choose from including Lara from Tomb Raider and Monica Lewinski!


I have enjoyed being able to post to more than one group by using only one site.  
It is very convenient and easy to use.

            You have been warned.


I started my etrade adventure about a week ago.  
I wanted to save a little commission ($10) to make a trade with etrade rather than Schwab.  
The attempt to save $10 has cost me hours of lost productivity and endless frustration.

4/17
I start to open an account with e-trade.  
Like that you can put in your check information and do it all online.

4/17
The etrade site says that it's system for transferring money is down.  
I go ahead and transfer the money to my Schwab account instead and make my trade there.

4/17
I buy my shares of XYZ from Schwab

4/17
I decide that etrade is not all it is cracked up to be, so I call (waiting :45) and ask that my attempt at opening an account be cleared from their records.

4/19
I find out that, though my bank did the Schwab transfer, that I was charged $27 for NSF!  
Huh?


4/21
I check my transactions, and find that e*Trade did indeed do the transaction.  
I immediatley call customer mis-service at etrade.

4/21
Etrade says that my electronic transaction will take 11 business days to clear, and that I have to wait for my money.  
The person taking the call fails to understand that the transfer was not authorized in the first place, and that by holding the money away from me they are effectively stealing.  
A supervisor will call me in 20 minutes to talk 

4/21
No supervisor calls for an hour.  
I call back, this time, they put me through.

4/21
Supervisor promises me that everything will be taken care of.  
Takes my bank's phone number, my account number, and promises to work on it first thing Monday morning

4/24
No transaction occurs

4/25
I call again... nobody knows of such supervisor.  
Furthermore, they can not just do what she claimed to be able to do.  
I request supervisor.  
I go on hold for :20.  
They come back, say supervisor will call me back in :15.  
No call.

4/25
I call back an hour later.  
I explain again.  
I get to another supervisor.  
Says she will call the bank and take care of everything (time two) ... will email me when everything is fixed

... and that brings me to the present.  
I still do not have my money back.  
I would not allow these clowns to manage a rock... much less my stock portfolio.  
Don't walk... run!!! 
from these people!  
Anything is better.  
Putting money in your mattress is better.  
A rip-off of the grandest of scales!

            eGroup is an email community manager, you can use it to create mailing list to send updates of your web site to members, or use it to communicate with a Group of your friends instead on using standard email's CC, or even Search for Help on a Given Subject (Need Help with programming? 
Go to a Programming eGroup and ask there,you would get your answers, eGroups are one of the best ways to get help!)


With your Group (as an Owner) You have a set of options to use, for example:
-Manage Messages: (Delete,Edit, or manage Pending Messages)
-Manage Members: (Add,Remove,Invite and Ban Members or Accept pending membership)
-File Sharing: (Each group can have a Total of 20 MB of File Storage) Members Can be notified
-Bookmarks(Links): You can have an almost unlimited number of Links and Categories (for sharing links with other members)
-Database: You can any number of Pre-Defined Databases(Address Book, CD Collection,FAQ ...etc) or Define your own Database
-Polls: Add Any number of Polls (with different options as: Chosing one answer or multiple answers, show participating users, auto-close poll) all that comes with members' notifications
-Chat: Chat along with other members of the group (or guests)
-Inivte and Promote: You can Invite members to join your eGroup(unlike directly adding them, you do not have a 100-members-per-day limit, also it is better than to abuse them by forcing them to join), the Promote Gives you the Codes needed to create (join eGroup) Links and Forms -Good for web site owners
-You also have an Activity page , it logs all moderator/member and guest activities in the Group (from posting messages, polls ...etc)
-The Settings Section allows you to make the different settings for the group (including renaming the group)
You can also set permissions for all the members and moderators as well as File Sending (Sending Files on an Event ie Member joining,Member Leaving, or sending a message every 2 weeks or 1 month[useful for sending Rules and reminders])

The only Disadvanatage about all that is that eGroups is now owned by Yahoo! 
and yahoo is forcing you to get an ID so you can "Link" it with your original email account at eGroups.

Yahoo! 
also remodeled the eGroups groups' Directory (the original eGroups' directory was based on the Open Directory Project) but yahoo changed in , I think that was really annoying, there are some categories that where completely removed and the eGroups under it was taken to an upper level (PHP eGroups are now found under Internet :( and not PHP, seems that Yahoo! 
does not 'like' php, maybe its just me)

In case you didn't like the new 'look' for the eGroups I suggest you go to an International eGroups page ( www.egroups.co.uk works just fine, since all the eGroups share the same main database!)


eGroups is still the 'one' when it comes to email based communities. 
I never tried their support but you can find alot of Support Groups that are willing to help you if you can!


Well , thats all what I have to say , enjoy eGroups!!

            This last year has been a real life nightmare for my family and friends.  
My husband was dying of liver failure and more and more people wanted to be advised as to his condition.


I tried to set up a mass mailing list, which worked, but it also took a lot of time and someone was always getting left out or changing their email address without advising me.  


I also tried having certain people in charge of keeping others up to date.  
But that failed too when those people had their own problems to deal with.


Ultimately, I decided that perhaps a newsletter would work, but caring for an ailing adult is a full time job, who has the time!  
So one night I saw a commercial for egroups and decided I had nothing to lose and gave it a try.


The next day I set about sending out invitations to those on the email list and sure enough the people began to join and the group got quite active.  


It wasn't until late at night in May that I realized just how important this group would be.  
We got the call to go to the hospital as they had a liver for my husband, a transplant that could save his life.  
I wrote one quick message to the group letting them know we were on our way.  
The next week when our local bank set up a donation fund for him, I found the best way to get the news out was to make a post to the group about that.  
I didn't have to deal with piles of email wanting answers as the members were able to help answer each others questions.  
What one person might need to know, another one had the answer for.  
It also made quick work of getting the donation fund out in the open to help pay for the mounting medical costs.


Now my husband is home, feeling better then he has in years and the group is still intact.  
It has been wonderful to be able to share the joy of this second chance at life with them and in turn they have helped me out in so many ways.  


Egroups is also a moderated group, so when one person showed up that I knew was not a friend of ours (more like a stalker) it was easy to take care of that problem.


I would recommend egroups to anyone that needs to maintain a large mailing list for whatever the reason.  
It truly has been a time saver, and money saver for us!


Thanks so much egroups for just doing what you do!

                I originally signed up for Onelist before it was integrated with Egroups.  
I have found Egroups to be easy to run and fun to use.  
The easily customizable options are wonderful.  
If you don't like so much e-mail in your inbox, you can elect to have only one condensed e-mail a day, or to just read the messages at their web site!  

    
There are many other features such as file sharing and web-polling.  
I have found that many of my list members are confused with the web polling. 
The automatic e-mail instructions make it seem like you can answer by e-mail when you actually have to go to the web site and find the polling area.  
I have had to coach several members through this process.

   
Also Egroups can be annoying if you want to send out a daily newsletter.  
Since other members cannot post to the newsletter, you find yourself having to not only write and send the newsletter, but go to the web page and approve of your own e-mail before it is posted to the group!  
Redundant and unnecessary, this has me looking for another group.

## Topic: E*TRADE could do better
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I suppose E*TRADE does the job for a reasonable price, but I think they could do better. 
Whenever I use E*TRADE, I find myself speculating about what's going on behind the scenes. 


I suspect they have a bunch of web servers and they have a bunch of accounting mainframes, and the two are pretty much cobbled together.


An example of why I suspect it's all held together with digital duct tape ... 
Last Wednesday, I put in a mutual fund buy order. 
On Thursday, it was still listed on the Open Orders page. 
On Friday, it completely disappeared from the Open Orders page and there were no charges against my cash balance. 
On Monday, the transaction reappeared - completed. 
Good thing I didn't put in another order when the first one disappeared!


I also suspect they have a staff of CGI script programmers working without benefit of an overall web site design.


I really wonder about pages like the Account Activity view. 
It looks like they painstakingly copied the format of the 1960's mainframe line printer printouts they use in the back office, complete with cryptic one- and two-letter codes. 
Why must they use the letter "B" instead of spelling out the entire word, "Buy"?


Why do some of the report pages have headers with all capital letters, some with only the first letter capitalized, and others with a mixture? 
I know stuff like this doesn't matter as far as functionality, but that kind of sloppiness probably carries over into other areas.


My worst experiences were when I first started using E*TRADE, trying to find information in their "E*TRADE Help Center".


To be fair, there are a lot of good things about E*TRADE. 
It's very convenient to trade online and you've gotta love "securities protected to $100 million" (not that I'm anywhere near that limit).


I haven't used any of the other online brokers, so I don't know how E*TRADE compares.

            I really do love eGroups. 
I have two of my own which were very easy to set up and edit. 
I have also deleted a few past ones I created which was completely easy and hassle free. 


One thing I really like a whole lot about eGroups is that you can choose what goes into your profile and whether or not it is seen by the other members of eGroups. 


For instance in my profile I opted not to have my address filled in and that was okay. 
I also can opt not to have it show the address field at all in my public profile if I don't want it to. 


You can also add a link to a picture for your profile and a link to a website. 
Also there is a space for your ICQ # or AOL IM ID. 
Since I am not on AOL IM that much I opted to add my ICQ #. 


I won't say I have never received any spam from my association with eGroups as there really is no way to tell. 
Anyone who gets to your profile and sees your email address can send you spam and you would have no idea where they got it from. 
Also if you include an email address in your ICQ information and put your ICQ # in your eGroups profile a resourceful spammer could find you that way. 


I also like that you can choose from HTML email or text email. 
Also you can enter in extra email addresses up to five so you can choose at any time to post from a different email account. 


I am a member of 21 total eGroups with two of those being my creations. 
I was absolutely thrilled to find an eGroup for AMC vehicle fans. 
I love it because I can get together with others and talk about my favorite cars. 


I also like the option to have a daily digest of messages delivered or receive single emails. 
I have a mix in the groups I belong to with the majority being a daily digest. 
This makes it much easier for me. 
I only have some on individual emails as they are from my Paint Shop Pro groups because the digest cuts out the image attachments. 


And if you are going to be away that is no problem either. 
You don't have to unsubscribe from all your groups. 
You can just go to No Mail/Web Only and you won't have your mail server loaded down with emails while you are gone. 
Then when you come back you can view the archive on the website to catch up on what happened when you were away. 


Probably my favorite thing about eGroups even though I don't use it is the family filter. 
I have mine set to off because adult content does not bother me. 
However, when my son gets older I may go ahead and use it. 
I would also use it if you don't want to see groups with adult content. 
I did a search and there are 8559 adult eGroups. 


Now for the BEWARE Message:
I have noticed several times since being registered at eGroups that I get signed up for groups I did not request to be signed up for from an account that is not mine and I don't know the password to. 
This is highly aggravating and requires me to have the password emailed to me using any information I have been able to learn or to email eGroups and tell them what happened. 
They have taken care of it quickly the one time I have asked them to do this. 
I have been signed up in this fashion a total of five times. 
Not really bad though when you consider I have been a member of eGroups for a long long time now. 
Just be on your guard. 


I would recommend eGroups to everyone because there really is a group for everyone. 
It does not matter what interests you have, you can find one or most likely more eGroups that discuss it. 
Also if you were not able to find a group that matched your interests you can always create one..

		As a very short lived former student with Western International University let me say the following: (a) the school is a joke (but then again it's an heir of the UOP; (b) Financial Aid is truly a joke; (c) My enrollment Advisor is nowhere to be found; (d) I have been told nothing but "unusual" lies I've never heard of in an educational environment; (e) They talk a good game until they get you in and then they think they have you hooked; (f) It took darned near 4 weeks into a 9 week program before my academic advisor contacted me; (g) They literally provide you with the paperwork which clearly implicates their "unusual" practices; (h) They assume you know no better than to believe their B.S.; (i) I reported them to a division of the DOE inturn, the DOE representatives have contacted the Financial Aid Office of Theft on several occasions regarding my case. 
To date, The Financial Aid Office of Theft has not returned any of their phone calls. 
Go figure. 
My next step is to file a complaint thru the Arizona Attorney General's Office based on Theft By Deception, Negligence and a few other choice words. 
Both institutions should be drawn and quartered for the numerous violations students have brought to the attention of the DOE and whomever else. 
You know a problem exists when EMPLOYEES post negative feedback about their employer. 
Take a hint: Find another online school to devote your time and hard earned money too or else you too will be SCREWED over many times.

## Topic: The Most Popular But Not the Best

## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I tried E*Trade for two reasons:  I was unhappy with how hard it was to deposit funds in my SureTrade (see my parallel review of this service) account, and E*Trade offered me a $75 startup bonus.  
It turned out neither reason was good enough; I'll take SureTrade hands down.


SureTrade's combination of cheap trades and no-frills service pays off big time.  
I waited until trying a second online broker, E*Trade, before writing either review.  
I was disappointed with several aspects of SureTrade, but I knew that many of these disappointments might be typical in the business.  
Was I ever right about that one!  
Read on.


Your first hurdle will be getting money into your account.  
I could not believe they could handle online trading, but not online account deposits!  
I was pis? 
I mean, er, urinologically challenged.  
You have to mail in your first deposit, which I did with a cashier's check in order to avoid the five-day check-cashing delay.  
I tried wiring money in for the second deposit, but because I use different versions of my name on each account (when not using my dharma name Daruma, I go by my middle name), the wire would not and could not go through.  
Now tell me why they could not match up on social security number!


Anyway, when I signed up for E*Trade, I got a better handle on all this.  
E*Trade was just as bad for funding an account.  
Worse yet, I sent my check in with an offer to add $75 to my account as a sign-up bonus, and they failed to honor their offer.  
Naturally, I intend to hound them unmercifully.


If you want lots of frills, perhaps you should go to E*Trade, but I get my frills elsewhere, from Quote.com, so they just get in the way.  
I far prefer SureTrade's straightforward interface.  
I can do almost anything I want from the Trading screen.  
In E*Trade you really have to search to find the equivalent functionality of SureTrade's Trading screen, and it's a pain.  
Too big a pain to want more of.


Finally, you will be disappointed to discover that SureTrade's $7.95 per trade applies only to market trades, that is, trades made at prevailing market rates.  
If you use a limit order, that is, specify the minimum/maximum price you want to sell/buy at, it is $9.95 per trade.  
Add $5 more if the stock price is below $2 per share.


Is this horrible?  
Well, I was shocked to discover my trades at E*Trade are $19.95.  
At that rate, I expect to use that account only in emergencies; probably will transfer it all over at some point.  
I'll use it for longer-term investing, but clearly that price is too high if you want to do fast-turnover trading.


All in all?  
Go elsewhere, or make the higher trading commission worthwhile by going to a fuller-service house.

		I am also attending devry. 
I think its an ok school, however I am a little pissed off because last semester I found out that they are going to get rid of my major BMI. 
To make it worse I have to take most of my core classes online. 
Now I am having second t aughts wether I want to major in BMI or switch majors. 
I only got 2 semester left, so I think I am going to complete this major, then I will double major in CIS. 
I would only have to take three semesters more to get a degree in CIS.

Oh yeah, I got to say that the student advisor's are the worst, they are lazy and they make the student workers do their job. 
Also, the only reason there getting rid of BMI is because they are not making enough money of it because there are not that many students in that major. 
OH but they love GSP, they got a bunch of students in that major most of them dont even do there work they just play video games all day.


I am paying for my education so I expect to get the best education available. 
with devry making me take my BMI courses online and just basically alienating me I say that they are not doing a good job.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            A few years ago I joined an eGroup and quickly unsubscribed.  
EGroups just wasn't for me.  
I didn't like the group I had been solicited to join and wasn't familiar with eGroups.  
I hated it.  
Recently, I joined several new groups and have had great success with them.  
I found groups that were perfect for me and have made some friends in the process.  


About eGroups

If you've not already joined aGroup, joining is simple.  
Go to http://www.egroups.com or http://www.groups.yahoo.com (as of August '00 eGroups has merged with Yahoo!) 
and browse through the hundreds of topics and thousands of different groups.  
Choose a group that's right for you, and join.  
Some groups allow you to join automatically, others you have to wait for authorization to join.


More than likely you can find a group that is perfect for you, but if by chance, you don't, you can always create your own group.


If you have a yahoo account, you can use it to join, which makes it rather simple.


Features

·  Messages- Messages can be sent/received directly from your email or from the group page itself

·  Files- You can upload files(pics, text files, etc.) to your group(s)

·  Chat- You can chat through the group page with other members of that group

·  Delivery options -receive individual emails
                           -receive digests (multiple
                           emails sent to your email in one
                           message)
                           -"no mail" which allows you to 
                           check your messages on the group
                           page, rather than receiving email

·  Member Profiles- listed in your eGroup

·  Directories and bookmarks- (you can add your name to the group's directory and add a bookmark to your website 

·  Polls- Members can create polls for other members to vote 

·  Calendar- Members can create a calendar to keep up with upcoming events involving group members

·  Archives- All emails sent from when the group began to present day are kept in the archives

·  "My Groups"- So you can keep up with all of your groups easily, each group you are subscribed to is listed on the yahoo.groups website under the "My Groups" heading

More

Groups, Groups, and More Groups!

As I said, there are TONS of groups for you to join.  
From Mothers of children with ADHD groups to Religious groups and even to groups for members of Epinions.


Watch Out!

If you haven't got a lot of time on your hands, you may want to limit the number of groups you join, as it can get overwhelming to keep up if you join too many.


Friends, advice, support
It's easy to make friends within your group.  
Everyone is always eager to offer you advice and support when you need it.


Yahoo!
Groups vs. old eGroups
Lots of folks, myself included seem to prefer eGroups as opposed to the new Yahoo!
Groups.  
It's basically the same thing, but I don't feel Yahoo! 
needed to acquire it too.

		It is amazing the comments about a univesity. 
I could go to a local college and get a poor education also just from a lack of effort. 
That would seem to fit any of these people. 
You only get out what you put in. 
I am curious though, how many of you folks that got out of this college went on to another college and got your degree? 
anyone?
 
Yep, sure is easy to complain though. 
CTU has a north central regional accreditation, but I suppose you know better that the accreditation board? 
Sure you do.....
 Try this, enroll in a brick and mortar, get your degree and then come back and tell me what a lousy school it is because at least I know you tried to better yourself. 
I am halfway through my program and my wages have gone up by $10,000 already. 
Why, because I spend the time to learn and not get spoonfed like some of my buddies who went to brick and mortar schools.
 
Have fun with your life I am sure you will find plenty to bitch about as time passes you by....without any degrees!

 
Thank you for your attention.
 
Student of CTUOnline. 
(with a regional accreditaion and soon to offer PE courses, not bad for a terrible college huh?)

		I have not started with Devry yet but I do this year. 
So far it seems great especially for someone like me, a full-time employee. 
I am very fortunate and almost right out of high school with a very average GPA and only 20; I already make above $45,000 a year as a programmer with a large health care company for over a year and have had 3 promotions up in the first year and a half. 
I decided that I want to go ahead and get a bachelors in CIS so I will not be capped in my salary and companies can not use my lack of an education as leverage to pay me cheap. 
Many people are knocking Devry but I have seen them to be a very great school for people who really push themselves. 
I've already asked my HR department if a Devry degree is credible and here was the answer: "If you earned you education, its credible." 
With further communication with my HR department I've come to the conclusion that if you didn't just purchase your degree but you earned it by learning and expressing your skill and abilities you and your degree are credible to any company. 
If a company does not accept my degree, without seeing my ability I would not want to work for such a bias company. 
Keep in mind my company is strict in every process especially being a Public traded company that complies with the all the public company acts. 
The only reason I would see Devry not being credible is totally dependent on the student. 
Its all on you, not the paper you have. 
If I can get the job at college-graduate starting salaries, plus 3 promotions in a year without any degree from any school and just a dimploma, I know without any doubt that with a degree from Devry I can move around and have better leverage with other companies. 
From what I saw and hear, you surely earn your degree at Devry, you must pass the class with a C to earn the credits, its only a year shorter than a typical 4 year program at a local college, and such a fast-paced career-oriented education is offered. 
If you want to go to college to receive that "college-life" or to get the "personality", "character", etc that a college campus and life gives you then go to a local university or high-held prestige school. 
But if you already know your career path, already have character and pesonality in your life, then Devry is a good option to consider. 
I plan on going to their Keller graduate school to get an MBA after my bachelors because on year of your bachelors counts for one year of earning your masters and so you only have one year left to finish your masters! 
I hated community college. 
It was so bland and the classes were huge (30 students or more sometimes) and the teachers were awful. 
I've noticed that the successful students at Devry are brilliant, goal-oriented people and know exactly what they are aiming for. 
If I end up having a bad experience with Devry, I'll come right back to this forum and explain why but I won't tell anyone not to go to Devry. 
I had a friend graduate from Devry with a business bachelors in project management and she seems to be doing fine and is heading to law school. 
It depends on your goals, yourself, your direction, your career, etc.

             I love Egroups, I belong to a couple groups where I've met some really nice people. 
I did however stumble across some really vulgar groups out there while looking for a group to exchange jokes. 
I thought the one group was a joke, but it turned out to be some really sick group that gets a rush from pooping in their own pants. 
No lie, I saw this group and almost wanted to puke! 
I know that people think I get a thrill out of junk like that, but there's a big difference between a cat on the toilet, a farting Eeyore and a real person crapping on themselves. 
People like that need to have their head examined!  
They need a better age verification system on Egroups because it was too easy to access.

 
I have encountered some even stranger groups, so I put the family filter on to avoid the weird sites all together. 
The family feature blocks the sickies groups so I don't have to get shocked when checking a group out.

 
The good part of Egroups is that you can send out messages to everyone in your group and have some good conversations via email. 
The service is free and you can even create your own group. 
One of the downfalls of egroups is that if you have a slow ISP or an email with a limit, you may find yourself over the limit very quickly if you have it set on individual emails. 
For groups like that a daily digest is best. 
I had joined one group a while back that if I didn't check my mail for an hour or more, I'd have hundreds of email messages. 
I had to leave that group because I really couldn't keep up with all the messages.

 
Egroups is easy to use and they don't sell your email address to anyone that I know of because I haven't been spammed by anyone yet. 

 
I belong to one group now that is very small, yet extremely active. 
The people in there have become very good friends. 
I find Egroups to be a very rewarding site. 
You can make tons of new friends, and have fun.

            I have been using eGroups for several years now both as an end-user and list-owner as well as moderating several groups.  
A few years ago it was called OneList.  
Just last year it merged and is now called eGroups.  
I can't say the service went down or up at this time.  
From my standpoint it remained pretty consistent.  
There was a week during the actual changeover where the list was down for maintenance but this is routine with all lists.  


eGroups is good about notifing list owners in advance when scheduled maintenance will occur.   
They have a special list for sending these messages out hosted by eGroups, of course!


The most recent change is the new merger with Yahoo.  
I have noticed since that time that there are some less than desireable new lists on the site popping up dealing with pornography of all kinds.  
I think eGroups could do a better job of moderating these lists.  
I don't think a place like eGroups needs that kind of stuff.  
Most of the groups are family oriented and you can certainly find a list to interest you.  
They have hundreds of lists from sports to pets to saving money!  
You will find what you are looking for at eGroups.  
And best of all the service is completely free to listowners and users.

## Topic: Etrade- Good but not perfect
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            Overview:
I've been using Etrade's online trading for about 4 years.  
I've got both an IRA account and a regular, options enabled account.  
Overall, I think that the service is adequate, and the prices reasonable,  but there is still some work to be done.  


Money Market Checking Account - Terrific.  
This is by far the best feature of etrade.  
I can get money market rates with no minimum balance, and free checking!  
I guess their (correct) assumption is if my money is there, I'm more likely to execute more trades, and pay the broker fees.  
But i still like it a lot anyway.


Help - Terrific.  
I've learned almost all that I know about trading, options, technical analysis and the financial markets from etrade's help.  
They are constantly updating it and it is genuinely useful, especially the tutorials on options trading.


Web site layout - Good.  
Lots of features, pretty well organized.  
I can access my data fairly well, though there is no customization ("my etrade") which would be quite nice.  
The site itself is a little slow, but not overly so.  
It has improved considerably since I've started using it 4 years ago. 
Overall, layout is intuitive.


Trading - Good.  
I've had some problems using the online trading feature, and I've actually missed some lucrative trades because I couldn't access the system while it was "down for maintenance".  
On the other hand, I missed some bad trades too.  
Furthermore, etrade does give you the option of calling them up to make the trade, though being a child of the internet, talking to people on the phone about financial matters makes me uneasy.  


Research - Good.  
I like their research, and though I am often baffled by technical analysis, it is quite easy to access and I'm learning more and more as I go.  
They also have very good access to financial news sources, such as thestreet.com, which I really like quite a bit.


Quotes - Needs work.  
I don't use the quotes feature on etrade very much, I usually go to Yahoo, unless I want options quotes, or real-time quotes.  
Frankly, the few seconds longer I've got to wait for quotes is quite annoying.  
I don't have access to Level 2 quotes since I'm not an "active trader".  


Account Status - Poor.  
This feature is often "down for maintenance".  
Etrade has to do better in keeping account balances and portfolio data online more often.  
I understand that they have to back up their data, but they need to find a way to do it that doesn't affect end users.

            ****11/30/00
This just in!  
Today I recieved a card in the mail from E*TRADE. 
The Card read that as of TODAY, all E*TRADE customers will be charged a $15 fee each quarter if their account is below $5000!


I can't even believe this one!  
I thought this site was for the everday Joe?  
This was supposed to make it so anybody could go online and trade.  


Well, it is all clear now.  
Everyone must mean; Those who have not those who don't.  


Just thought I would let you know that, in case you haven't recieved your little postcard. 
By the way, they were very clever to send it out for us to recieve today, because I know for a fact that they are 3 days behind on account maintenances.  
Believe me I know!  
You won't have time to pull out before you are charged this quarter, so don't bother panicking.  
Just make sure that you do pull out before the next one.  
Otherwise you could be broke and oweing them money before June!







I selected E*Trade because I know it so well, you would think I worked there...hmmmmm....maybe I do.

The best thing about E*trade is the concept of online trading.  
They came into our computers with bells on...but they are going out with red flags.

I would not recommend this service to my worst enemy.  
E*trade has not only been the pioneers of online trading, but they have created a new level of "PHONE RAGE".  
I have had long wait times before but 2 HOURS!!!??? 
Come on!  
I suppose I could hang up but it's my money!  
And someone please tell me why they can't at least bring the trading price down to meet, other online brokers???  
This was supposed to be a way for the everydaySally to trade on the Stock Market.  
I sure hope Sally has an extra $19.99 everytime she wants to buy a $3 IPO!  

Seriously it is not funny the way these people are over charging and underservicing. 

Underservicing is an understatement if you are one of the lucky individuals who had to wait 3 months for your $400 rebate, or maybe they lost it!  
Yes or how about your frequent flyer miles, good thing you didn't have plans to go anywhere this year!  
Or how about your $75 bonus that they didn't tell you until later you wouldn't get it unless you had a minimum balance of $1000.  
I won't even go into the numerous times that I can not even get into the website.

Personally, I could do with out E*trade and their fancy commercials and big egos and little effort.

Thank you very much!

		Capella University suffers the same problems that all for-profit institutions have get the money! 
Never mind if the University drops the ball; it seems their policy is: never admit fault, because it is always the customers fault! 
I tried Capella because I believed in online education, but given my experiences I would not recommend them. 
In the time I have been there I have seen the names on the instructions list change often, and given what Capella pays the adjunct faculty I am surprised they put up with it. 
It is sad when an institution is comprised of nearly 90% adjuncts. 
Well we can see where Capellas priorities are I guess I would not mind paying a premium tuition rate if the institution was sponsoring research, but let us face it, Capella is a meat grinding machine get them in, spit them out! 
From an academic point of view, the faculty is great for the most part. 
However, from a business point of view, they are just like any other for-profit business masquerading as an education institution. 
Perhaps I am cynical, but I am uncomfortable what I see coming out of the institution. 
Just my two cents.

## Topic: Good brokerage, great promotions
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            Everybody knows E-TRADE by now. 
I first signed up for E-TRADE when I had a Morgan Stanley Online account and they informed they would be raising commissions from 14.95 to 24.95. 
With so many advertisements for trades starting at 7.99, I thought "screw MSDW". 
I jumped ship to ET.


ET offers banking, home loans, and other services, but I only have the brokerage. 
I also have an IRA through ET and like how I can switch back and forth from my IRA and regular account very easily. 
I also can deposit funds directly from my checking account (takes 3 days) at no charge. 
I have called to speak with a representative a couple of times, and after you get through the annoying touch tone menu, everything is OK. 
I hated the menu, but once I got past it I was connected to a live and helpful human very quickly.


When it comes to trades, ET seems to be prety quick. 
When putting in market orders they seem to often get the order done for me at a "good" price. 
I say "good" because I can't know for certain if I would have saved 1/16 by using Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, etc. 


I have not had any major problems with ET. 
ET attracted many investors through really big promotions... cash bonuses, vacations, electronics, if you can name it ET probably offered it at one point or another. 
I signed on and got a $300 certificate for Microcenter. 
Sounded good except I soon discovered that Microcenter has nothing good, and whatever they do have is sold at full retail price. 
Now that ET has a bigger customer base, their promotions aren't as lavish as before. 
However they do still give a $50 referall bonus for any friends you can get to sign up with them. 
Just keep your eyes out for any crazy promotions, you never know. 
This company has been known to give the best ones.


Asides from ETRADE, I also use Datek and Schwab. 
I haven't really noticed a big difference among online brokers. 
All seem to execute trades quickly, and the websites are easy to navigate.  
i am an experienced investor, so "hand-holding" is not important to me. 
However if you like research tools, ET doesn't really offer much. 
Morgan Stanley and Schawb by my experiences, both offer much better research tools. 
Good research tools really come in handy when you're doing school projects on companies :)

            I can't exactly remember when I first joined, but it was back when it was still onelist.com....I joined some homeschooling lists and then later I joined some of the list that allow you to sell your used items, like books and things like that.


I started off to get homeschool supprt and share tips and ideas with others...and to purchase used books and curriculum for my children.


I have always had great experiences and helpful people to show me around. 
I ended up joining way too many and was overwhelmed with email...but I toned it down and stayed with just a few...also set my email to come in digest form rather than individual emails...one can only take so much email:-)

Now I use it mostly for books, both buying and selling our own as well...it has been a huge blessing to my family and allowed me to not only continue our homeschooling (tihght budget) but also to actually make a little extra money on the side!


There are tons of great areas of interest in there and I would guess, something for everyone!

		Ouch! Some pretty harsh comments posted here, not all unwarranted. 
As a current student UMUC-Europe, I can confirm that not all comments posted here are loaded, but I must say, many are. 
Does anyone really buy that the Director is posting “student's names, social security account numbers, and addresses on the World Wide Web”. 
If you do, try checking that claim. 
I doubt you’ll find much to back it up; I tried and failed. 
But, as I mentioned, many claims posted here have sustenance. 
Sometimes, the books assigned to a course are sub par (and I stress SOMTIMES), grades for some courses come in slowly (really annoying), and “in-class” courses get canceled often (in Europe). 
But some of these issues are very easily explained (even justified) if one takes the time to think about, as one post asked, “what is UMUC doing in Europe”? 
Well, they are there serving the military community with scattered all about Europe and the Middle East. 
You see, UMUC has a contract with the Department of Defense to educate the military community stationed overseas. 
Someone has to provide for the education of military members and their families while stationed overseas. 
It is the Department of Defense that dictates what kind of programs can be offered to their community overseas. 
In fact, it is the DOD that pretty much runs the show. 
Now, To conduct an in-class course (Face-to-face), there has to be enough people registered in that class to carry it on, and if there is not, well, the class gets canceled and field representatives try to encourage students to take distance learning courses (that never get canceled) in lieu. 
With bases closing, and more and more of our soldiers being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan etc.. (and their wives and children going back to the States), enrollment (in-class) is falling and classes are being canceled. 
I also here a lot of complaints directed at the faculty and staff at UMUC-ED. 
Just a short insider bit of info I got from a friend that works there: UMUC-Europe employees get paid roughly half of what their counterparts in the states get paid AND, given that they are much less resourced, do twice the work. 
I would assume that is a factor in their oftentimes less-than-sunny dispositions. 
To put in my two cents of the University, I’ll say this: I have done my research, and for what it is (an institution catering to the military community, ..and think about what that means), UMUC does a great job providing education for military members stationed overseas. 
Yes, things could be done better, but I guarantee that it is the BEST University with a home-base overseas if only for it’s broad range of programs (in comparison), it’s quality of education, and it’s flexibility. 
I graduated with a B.S. from a great University in the States, so I like to think I know what good instruction is. 
UMUC-ED may not live up to my previous institutions academic standards, but you know what, I think to think that you get what you give. 
Just a few cents from a UMUC-ED student.

## Topic: Addicted to Egroups.
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            OK I admit it. 
I am addicted to egroups. 
There are times I growl and curse it, but that's usually in correlation to if for some reason my mail is not getting to me. 
My email server probably hates me for my addiction. 
As a matter of fact I have crashed a number of my email accounts at free places like hotmail and crosswinds and flashmail. 
How? 
Because I don't know when to say enough is enough. 
There have been times I have been subscribed to over 40 groups. 
Right now I own 2 groups and am a member of 22 more. 
What kind of groups? 
Well you can find almost anything you want. 
If I do a breakdown of my groups (including the ones I started) it would look like this: 9 groups associated with graphics and/or graphic making, 2 dealing with webdesign/programing such as PHP, 6 poetry lists, 2 support groups dealing with rape, abuse, and other similar issues, 2 groups dealing with Epinions, 2 groups dealing with site updates, and the one egroups provides for moderators of groups. 
Now unless you are at your computer as much as I am I do not recommend going on a list joining spree like I have. 
It is nothing for me to get over 500 emails a day just from egroups. 
Are you seeing how this has become an addiction?


Egroups gives me a way to learn and share with people I may have never encountered otherwise. 
If I have a problem with trying to code something in a page I fire off an email to one of my groups and usually get an answer fairly quickly. 
If things from the past get overwhelming I can email an SOS and someone is there to talk me through it. 
When I write a poem I can send it and get honest opinions on it. 
Not that I have written to many poems lately...I have been too absorbed in Epinions :) I highly recommend some of the Paint Shop Pro (usually referred to as PSP) lists to anyone who wants to learn how to use the program. 
It's like getting classes for free. 


The site is easy to navigate which is a big issue to me. 
I hate going to a site and feeling like I am lost in a cold and hostile environment. 
I set it to remember me whenever I go to the site. 
That way I don't have to log in every time. 
That works great for me as I am the only one that uses my computer. 
When I get to the site there are links to my groups I am already in as well as a search feature towards the top of the page so I can find more groups to join if I so desire. 


Signing up for egroups is easy. 
It's the usual questions about email address, date of birth, gender, zip code, country, agreeing to the term of service, and the option to sign up for other newsletters. 
Once you do this and reply to the confirmation email you are set to start joining groups. 
Features that are available to groups, but also depend on the owners decisions include file uploading, posting links, a calendar, polls, and archives of messages.


From a moderator/owner perspective egroups gives you complete control over your group. 
You can set a welcome message, set a footer on each email that is sent through the group, choose whether or not to archive messages, set moderators and decide how many privileges they have, decide whether or not to moderate posts and/or group membership, you can set it to where a file is sent to a member on joining, unsubbing, pending membership and more. 
Also for each member you can set how they receive their mail, whether their posts are moderated, and/or ban them. 
There are many more features, but unless you want this review to double or triple in size I better stop LOL.


OK seeing as I mentioned that I growl and curse it at times I will go into the why's. 
Sometimes mail is a bit slow going through. 
I guess that is to be expected when you consider the sheer volume that must pass through their servers. 
Really the only thing I wish they would change is maybe to have you set an alternate address that they can use to notify you if messages sent to you have bounced. 
I went about 10 hours with no mail because an email bounced due to my server being down for a few minutes. 
I didn't realize that my account needed resetting because I didn't even know my mail had bounced. 
Finally I went to send a message to a group about "why is it so quiet?" 
and I got an email from egroups saying they couldn't deliver my message because my account needed to be reset. 
It wasn't a problem *to* reset, just click on a link in the email and it was done...I just wish there was some way for me to have been notified 10 hours earlier that I needed to do this.


All in all I love egroups. 
I am hopelessly addicted. 
Maybe there needs to be an Egroups-Anonymous group. 
Then again it'd probably be hosted on egroups :)

## Topic: I won my digital camera from them!! 
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
I started with Ecircles when it was still in it's infancy. 
I originally signed up for a chance to win a digital camera. 
I went for it because it was not based on luck but on skill. 
I actually won twice but did not claim the other camera to be fair to others who were trying for this camera. 


I really think this was a great idea and one I wish I had thought of. 
I put it right up there with the creation of Epinions.com. 
*grin* The basics of it is that you can create groups based on your interests and invite friends to join. 
You can also create groups for your family only. 
I have done this so I can share with my family news of what is going on with my life and they can find out at their convenience. 


There is much you can do when you have created or joined a group. 
My favorites have to be the photo albums and the add links features. 
Anyone in the group can create and upload photos and only those people that are in that group can view them. 
A new feature has been added that also allows you to order prints from the photos uploaded. 
At the time of this writing there is also a contest you can enter when you order prints to win yet another digital camera. 
I am not going to go for it as mine that I won before still works great. 
I mean no point in being greedy, right?


The add links feature is a great way to share your favorite links or promote your own sites that you have created. 
People you invite can invite other people so the possibilities for getting your site noticed are great if you have an active group. 


Some other neat features worth mentioning are:

Add News: this feature allows you to add news of your choosing to your circle. 
This way you can share news of what interests you or what may be related to the group you are in. 


Add An Event: you can add an event, or post news of a meeting to your group members. 


Add A Discussion: Start a discussion on your groups topic. 
Be forewarned though it may turn into a debate.
*grin*

Send Messages To Group: here you can email your entire group if you have something you think everyone should see or just want to say "Hi".


Add an Announcement: got something to say to everyone? 
You can post it as an announcement.


Text and Voice Chat: hold a chat and invite all or some members from the group. 
I have used both and they are really fun.


Add A File: got an MP3 you want to share, how about a neat piece of freeware you found or that cool .wav you came across the other day? 
You can add it here. 


Create a List: Keep track of your favorite items and let your group know what you like from books, movies and music to many other things.


Calendar: each group also has a calendar and you can post important dates on it. 
Birthdays, anniversaries, upcoming group meetings, special days, etc. 
The possibilities are limitless.


I recently created an ecircle called Addicted to Epinions. 
I created this as sort of a support group after reading some comments and reviews saying they needed a support group for their Epinions addiction. 
Well one exists now. 
*grin* If you want to join you can email me and I will send you an invitation. 
I also have several other groups I have created and will be more than happy to send a list of current categories. 
They really could use some more life. 
LOL. 


That is the one drawback I see really to Ecircles. 
You have to email people to join your groups. 
I do wish they would implement a sort of banner program for those that have websites to direct users to the groups they have created if they wished to. 
I would not use it for my family groups but would be a great resource to promote my general interest groups.


****UPDATE***** 
You no longer have to email people to join in your Ecircles. 
As of today --October, 7, 2000-- there is now a directory of Ecircles and you can make your existing circles public if you wish. 
There is still the option to keep them private if you like and I keep my family ones by invitation only. 
The current directory breakdown is as follows:

 Family and Genealogy  
 Sports and Recreation  
 Arts and Entertainment  
 Society and Culture  
 Health and Medicine  
 News and Media  
 Science  
 Games  
 Friends and Social Groups  
 School/Education  
 Business and Investing  
 Computers and Internet  
 Home and Garden  
 Shopping  
 International  
 Adult  
 
~~Update 12/06/00~~ 
The adult section has been removed according to an email I received from ecircles. 
Apparently it was causing too many problems for them. 
I have heard nothing since they informed me they were deleting that section. 
IMO it would have been better to enforce some sort of password protection or age authentication but was probably too much of a hassle so they opted for the easy way out. 


~~Update 06/11/01~~ 

Ahh Ecircles was fun while it lasted. 
Sadly Ecircles is no more. 
*pout* *sniff* I had a great time there. 
I had also created a private circle for just close friends and family so I could post pictures of my son and news of what he was doing. 


Good news though, there is another place much better than Ecircles in some ways. 
It is called CommunityZero. 
You can join free and I have several groups already in place. 


If you had an ecircle you can check it out at: http://www.communityzero.com/

		I am quite honestly appauled by some of the negative comments given for Capella University on this website. 
I graduated with a PhD in Psychology last year and was offered numerous job offers just prior to completion. 
Capella U has incredible faculty in the Harold Abel School of Psychology. 
My mentor and the rest of my dissertation committee were absolutely fantastic. 
I have absolutely no complaints about the entire PhD journey and highly recommend this school.

		DeVry University is a great investment. 
The school is going through some transistions as far as their student services is concerned. 
The undergraduate and graduate programs combined last year under the name DeVry University. 
The administration is diligently trying to combine the resources of the school to support both segments of the student body. 
I'm a graduate student at the school and the education I get is extremely relevent. 
I can't overemphasize that enough. 
The school gives students a knowledge base that makes them extremely competitive in the corporate world. 
The instructors really do have hands on experience in the areas in which they teach. 
I've received valuable advice from many of these real world professionals that I know I couldn't get at a traditional school. 
The drawbacks of the school is the poor customer service and relaxed admissions standards. 
I often have to call multiple times to get a request taken care of. 
The relaxed admissions standards comes from the school being a for-profit school. 
It often leads to poor group discussions or slackers as group members on group projects. 
I'm sure all colleges have their share of slackers so that shouldn't dissuade anybody from attending the school. 
Bottomline, DeVry is an institution that is focused on career development by teaching professional skills for career-oriented students. 
If you are interested in having a marketable degree from a school that is recognized across the nation then DeVry is the place for you. 
If you absolutely have to have a football team, pep rallies, and all the other mindless activities associated with college, I suggest looking elsewhere.

            I really like using eCircles for a variety of tasks.  
First and foremost, it is an excellent forum for keeping in touch with my friends and family across the country.  
We get to "talk" more over eCircles than we are able to on the telephone because rates are so high.  
My cousin is getting married, and we started an eCircle all about the event.


Speaking of events, eCircles is a great way to inform people of what is going on and even for invitations!  
For example, I recently produced a film, and we started an eCircle to keep everyone up to date on our progress, shooting schedule, etc.  
I don't know where we would have been without it.


Other features include a photo album, address book, organizer, and even a way to send virtual gifts to your friends online.  
It's really great.  
I highly recommend it to anyone with a big circle of friends or family online.

## Topic: Yawn-hoo.
## Score: 3.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            The mailing list I moderate moved to egroups about two years ago after having problems with our old service. 
Egroups was a good service, but the few changes that have taken place since Yahoo! 
bought out egroups have been a mixed bag.


The first change we noticed after the Yahoo! 
purchase was the sudden plethora of ads featuring naked teenaged bimbos on our group's website. 
Now our mailing list is adult-oriented so nobody found this offensive, but it was a bit strange, given that we're not exactly a male-only (or male-majority, or straight-majority) group. 
We did get rid of them because they didn't really appeal to most of us. 
But the only way we could do that was to mis-classify ourselves under Romance Advice. 
(Do you think Dear Abby will sue us?)


The second change we noticed was a definite decrease in message delivery speed. 
Even though Yahoo has had a full year to work out the kinks, it still isn't unusual to receive a message a full day after it's posted. 
Our group has users all over the world, and everyone has the same problem. 
It can be very frustrating, especially if somebody needs some emotional support or if there's a writing round robin going on.


On the good side, Yahoogroups has added some useful features to the egroups interface. 
We use the file storage option extensively to share photos, artwork, and stories. 
It's possible (if a bit clunky) to use the database with a spreadsheet program such as Excel to create mail/merge documents and to keep track of friends' holidays and religious observances worldwide. 
One big plus is that Yahoogroups accepts members from all over the world (some sites don't!)
, and that it's completely free. 
The archives are surprisingly easy to search, and archive searches are accurate. 
Best of all, private groups are kept private, which isn't always possible with other mailing list sites.


To summarize: Yahoogroups isn't perfect, but it isn't a disaster either. 
I only wish there was an site out there that accepted adult-only mailing lists but didn't bombard them with male-oriented porn.

		There appears to be an individual trashing Capella under a variety of names. 
I believe he was thrown out of Capella because of disrespecting other students. 
The school did the right thing and asked him to leave. 
He appears to have sour grapes. 
You can go to www.degreeinfo.com/forums and ask about him and you will be told that he is bad news. 
I am a Ph.D. grad in the school of Psychology at Capella. 
I have no complaints. 
I found the staff and the professors bending over backwards to help you be successful. 
You are treated with respect. 
I have buds of mine that got their Ph.D.'s traditionally and they have horror stories concerning doctoral committee members that from hell and total narcissists who loved to show superiority (and stupidity) via abuse. 
At Capella that kind of thing is very rare. 
It is a very good school. 
I teach at Miami Dade College, have a successful private practice and I get a lot of respect from other doctors in the community, often seeking my opinion on matters.

            Egroups has got to be one of my favorite places on the web.  
Where else can you find such amazing diversity?  
This is one site that truly has something for everyone.  
I have yet to find an interest or hobby that is not represented here.


Egroups is an email list.  
It takes a while to become comfortable with it, and you will definitely always have a mailbox full, but you'll soon see that the people you meet on these lists are well worth it.  
I began using egroups (then called Onelist) in October of 1998.  
I started my own recipe list and was thrilled to see membership grow from 2 people (my sister and I) to the well over 200 members we have today.  
I love the list so much that I joined 2 other lists, one being an Epinions Reading Circle.  
It is such a great way to get to know other people.  
It makes reading and rating so much more personal.


The Site
Egroups is very easy to navigate.  
You must sign in with your Email address and password, which can be saved so you don't have to do this each time you log on to the site.  
The groups you are enrolled in will show up on the left side of the screen and if you are a new member, then you may go looking for groups in various categories such as Arts and Entertainment, Sports, Shopping, and Home.  
There are so many to choose from that it can be confusing.  
The ones I've joined I've been invited or referred by the moderator, but egroups does have a nice search engine to help you find what you like.  
You are also given the option to start your own group right on the front page.  
It couldn't be easier!


Once you are a member of the group, you have choices to make.  
You will need to decide whether you want individual emails or digests, which take a days worth of messages from all members and puts them all in one email.  
You will also need to fill out your profile page so that people can get to know you better.  
There are many other "extras" for you to take advantage of as well.  
You have access to a calendar, shared files, a database (one of my lists uses this for member addresses), and polls.  
For my own cooking list, I've made a website full of recipes from the list, and use it to give members more information about the list.  
The possibilities are limitless.


As with any place that people gather, there are the inevitable problems that crop up.  
While most members are wonderful and you can glean much from their wisdom, I have never been on a list yet where there wasn't some sort of disagreement among the troops.  
Try not to take it personally, and attach yourself to the truly genuine members there.  
I have found that on every list I've been on, the good completely outweighs the bad.


If you are looking for an excellent place to make great friends, this is a great place to start.  
Egroups is by far the most popular site for free email-groups, and it's very easy to see why.  
The group choices are endless, the lists are almost Spam free and the people on the lists are great.  
Join one today!

## Topic: my email box ISN'T boring ANYMORE! .
; )
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Generally, I recommend Egroups to anyone interested in anything they would like to share with others.  
My email box is now interesting to read, I get email on topics that I am interested in! 
Every EGroup that I have been involved with have not been full of SPAM, useless advertising, or get rich quick schemes.  
As my interests and needs change, so can my egroups.  
The site is flexible, giving you the ability to receive individual emails, periodic digests of posts, or just to read off the web.  
If you have a specific interest and cannot find an email group, you can create a group of your own.  
There are tools on the website for you to promote your own group as well. 
Specifically, I so highly recommend FLYLADYMENTORS to any homemaker who feels overwhelmed by all of the challenges of housekeeping.  
This egroup is CHANGING my home to a more organized place!  
I learned about this group from one of the egroups that I occasionally read.  
I am ALWAYS amazed at how helpful, forthcoming and informative my fellow egroup members can be.  
This is a good place to feel a sense of community.  
Just go to WWW.EGROUPS.COM ...type in a subject that you are interested in....and see what comes up.  
Some of the best egroups that I've been in have been referred from other egroups so if one gets boring or too off topic a couple mouseclicks can fix that.

		One more thing. 
For those of you (It's really probably one person) complaining that you are referred to as a "learner" and not a "student". 
I hadn't even noticed it before but when I logged in to post to my threads, in the upper left hand corner of the window, just to the left of my name I see the word STUDENT. 
It's sickening how people whom for one reason or another have some sort of vendetta and are willing to trash an institution for their own personal failures. 
The operative word here is failure, as in loser. 
I'm also going to take another moment to express my personal experience in brick and mortar schools, which are also for-profit, constantly giving students the runaround, and teachers for whatever reason, along with counselors, bascially using cookie cutter techniques to 'guide' young people through a program with the only reason being of a money grab, extending a young person's stay. 
Alterior motives abound at all schools. 
Get over it, make a choice, then commit. 
Your reward is expressed in your work, dedication, and results. 
This is not dependent on anything but your own efforts.

## Topic: Competent, but not outstanding
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I have been a client of E*Trade for well over five years now, so I have had the chance to see them 'grow up' so to speak.  
Initially, I was drawn to low brokerage fees and the ability to perform research on-line.  
As well, it was one of the first companies to offer on-line trading services, so my choices were relatively limited.  
Since I previously had to work all of my transactions through a broker, this was heady stuff. 


As time has gone on, I have come to realize that E*Trade is pretty much a middle-of-the-road discount broker.  
Their trade prices are not the lowest (14.95 for market NYSE orders and 19.95 for limit or NASDAQ orders).  
Their news service is cluttered with PR items from WinningInvestments.com or WeCanMakeYouAMillion.com (I'm making these up to make the point.  
That is, I intended to make these up.  
They may already exist) that pepper their releases with ticker symbols so that they get seen by as many investors as possible.  
For example, the same news story appear under two separate stocks that I own entitled 'Fertilemind.com announces investment opinion on eBay' The only relation between the content of the story (an opinion about eBay) and my stocks was that 'Fertilemind.com analysts and members have written commentary on a variety of stocks such as:' followed by a list of stock symbols included the two that I own.  
Not only annoying.  
It makes the whole purpose of getting the news for my portfolio a waste of time.


On the plus side, E*Trade is getting into a number of side areas that might prove to be of benefit to its client base.  
For example, its purchase of Telebank might open up the ability to make a brokerage account more like a savings account.  
It was one of the first on-line brokerages to offer after hours trading capabilities.  
It also has a number of no-load, no-transaction fee index funds.


As I said initially, middle-of-the-road.  
Why do I still stay with E*Trade.  
Inertia, mostly.  
I've found myself doing most of my research at other sites and returning to E*Trade for execution.

## Topic: ETRADE-a pretty good online broker
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I have been using Etrade, since I started trading in the stock market.  
I had made one or two trades using a discount broker and had paid $50 per trade.  
That just wasn't getting the job done, so I moved my money to Etrade.  
I must say that I have made many trades with them, and I have only had a few minor problems.


You get free real-time quotes when you open an Etrade account, which is something that I really enjoy.  
I am able to watch my stocks move, and when I am ready to make a trade, I already know the current bid or ask price.  
I also use Etrade mail for some of my e-mail, and it has proved decent.  
I still like Yahoo mail better, but I do use Etrade for some of my message traffic.  
I don't normally use all of the site's features, so I cannot tell you much about the research and other features.  
I mainly watch my Account Balances and my portfolio.


The few problems that I have had with Etrade are mainly concerning delayed trade confirmations.  
On really volatile days, there have been times when I am not sure if a trade of mine went through or now, since I never got a trade confirmation back.  
If you try to call them when this happens, there are already a million other people on the phone, so you have to wait forever.  
But, in every instance, I have finally received my trade confirmation, and it did go through at the time it was supposed to.  
Other than that, I haven't had a problem with Etrade.


The trade prices are somewhat higher than other online brokers ($14.95 for a NYSE trade and $19.95 for a NASDAQ trade), but I also feel that you get more from Etrade.  
Since Etrade is one of the largest online brokers, they are going to do what it takes to keep their current clients happy.  
I see Etrade stepping out in the next few years as the dominant internet broker, as long as they continue to better their site and ask their customers what they want.


I would recommend Etrade to anyone that is looking for an online broker.  
I even helped my mom open an account.

		I am a recent UOP graduate now heading into my Master's degree program. 
First let me say, some may think that UOP's credits are not transferrable, but to the contrary, the reason why some colleges refuses to accept the university's degree is simply out of intimidation. 
Their motives are to simply discourage people from attending the UOP because traditional colleges are losing grounds to colleges such as the UOP. 
As a matter of fact, many colleges/universities are now adopting to the UOP way of teaching by trying to make education more accommdating to working adults such as myself.


Secondly, the myth about people not ever getting anything less than a C is strictly hear say, just ask the few students I know who has had to repeat their courses because of failed grades and slacking off. 
ALthough the team environment may seem to be discouraging, I have had incidents where professors were notified of an individual's lack of participation and having seen that individual fail or have grades lowered for those same reasons.


Now I may not be an online student, as I've attended all but one of my classes in a regular classroom setting, but I have had to take one class online and it was not easy. 
I worked my butt off and received pre-class emails and regular feedbacks from my professor. 
As UOP was NOT the only college that I've attended, I can safely say that there were no differences between meeting my academic requirements between the universities.


I've also interviewed with many employers only to find that some of those managers were UOP graduates as well. 
I believe that if the University of Phoenix was such a bad school as some try to implicate, many organizations, including the military would not invest their monies into sending their personnel their for educational enrichment.


I say that there will always be negative remarks about any college you attend. 
As they say, you can please some of the people but not all.

## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            E*Trade's service is outstanding.  
The features are great (I will go into depth later), and they allow a low Minimum Initial Investment (the Epinions page says $1000, but the minimum for me was $500).



Features

Home
The Home page gives some great tips on investing (different daily), as well as a Story Stock of the day and what different analysts are doing.  
It also has tips on using E*Trade and on investing in general, and has a Market Watch box that shows the market levels.


Portfolios
The Portfolios page is exactly what it sounds like.  
It allows you to view your portfolios (the stocks you hold).  
It also allows you to make portfolios of stocks you don't own.  
This is good for watching stocks you are thinking of buying or are just interested in.  
There are many different views for these portfolios, and it is helpful to see all of these views (Quick View, Performance, Research, Option Watch).  
I found that Datek didn't have that feature (you could only look at stocks you own).  
From here you can also view your Trading History and any News that has to do with the stocks that are in your portfolios.  


Markets
The Markets page is helpful for getting an overall view of what the market is doing.  
It contains important market news, as well as pre- and after-hours news.  
Finally, it contains an "A-List", which are stocks that are highly recommended by Analysts as well as by the E*Trade community.


Quotes  and  Research
This is the place to do all your research on the stocks you are considering acquiring.  
I find it to be amazingly helpful.  
E*Trade has Profiles for most companies, as well as analyst opinions and market sentiment.  
Also contained in the research section are insider sentiment, interactive charts and graphs, and news on the companies you are researching.  
You can also view real-time quotes and after-hours quotes, but you have to sign up separately because of higher-than-normal risk that needs to be taken to use that information (after-hours trading is kind of dangerous if you are not VERY experienced).


Trading
The trading section is, simply, where you can trade (buy and sell) stocks.  
Orders available are: Market Orders, Limit Orders, Stop Orders, and Stop Limit Orders.  
You can also choose whether you want to have the trade be valid for only that trading day, or until you cancel it.  
That is helpful if you want a stock only if you can buy it at a certain price today.  
You can also buy on margin, but you have to have a margin account.


Banking
The E*Trade bank account allows you to use E*Trade as your checking account.  
This makes it easy to trade with money out of your account and to put money from sales into your account.  
They also have very competitive interest rates.  
This requires an initial minimum deposit of $1000 (I think).


Account Services
Account Services shows a summary of your Total Portfolio, as well as the amount in your Securities Accounts and the amount in your bank account (if you have opened one and linked it to your brokerage account).  
From here, you can see all of your account activity and get various information on your account.


Other Information:
While your money is not in stocks and just sitting in your account, you can choose to have it automatically be in a Money Market Account, or just have it make interest like a savings account.

E*Trade is offering many deals:
-Get $75 in your account with an initial deposit of $1000 or more.

-Get 30 free trades with a deposit of $500 or more.

-Others offers all the time.

I have found that trades are executed very quickly, within 5 seconds usually for me.

## Topic: Find  Stock Pick of the Year with this Site 
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            With this site, it is entirely possible.  
The site has many, many features that are so good, but I thought I would focus on why this site is unique and what it offers in a way that other financial sites may not offer.  
The features that can help you find the next big stock pick or at least achieve some solid investment results without losing sleep over your investments are:  
 
Hottest Sectors
Hottest Industries
Biggest Losers
Stock Pick of the Week
Stock Screen
Mutual Fund Selection Criteria and the Fund Fact Sheet
IPO Offerings

HOTTEST SECTORS (UNDER STOCKS AND OPTIONS)
This section is broken down into categories of stocks ranging from $2 - $10 and then those greater than $10.


By browsing this section I found that there were actually other industry sectors besides technical and healthcare that had some potential.  
One such sector was Consumer/Non-cyclical.  
If you are interested in a particular company and you know what sector its falls under you can use the information contained in this area as a benchmark to evaluate your company against its peers.  
In other words, does your stock stand out, if so in what ways.  
With this information, you can then determine if you want to select that particular stock.


HOTTEST INDUSTRIES (UNDER STOCKS AND OPTIONS)

This section is also broken down into categories of stocks ranging from $2 - $10 and then those greater than $10.


By browsing this section, you can find the same type of comparative information as above.


BIGGEST LOSERS (UNDER STOCKS AND OPTIONS)

I love this area, because this is what I call the sale site.  
These stocks are on sale.  
A financial expert said that it is good to buy stock when they are on sale (You know the buy low, sell high theory).  
You can evaluate these companies and see if you think they are going to go up or down more and why they are making the moves they are making.  
Perhaps there will be one here that is in trouble, but maybe they will be bought out by a company that will cause their stock price to rise, or perhaps their efforts to turn around their situation will be successful.  
Put these companies in your portfolio manager, observe them, and when the time is right (for you) buy them.  
Often I like to buy them when they get below their 52-week low, if I feel they are going to come back up.  
For instance, I will be following the Gap,Inc. as it was one of the companies on the list.  
I would like to own some of this stock and this could be a time for me to buy it low.


STOCK PICK OF THE WEEK  (UNDER STOCKS AND OPTIONS)

There is a full write up on a company that has above average performance. 
I like to also put this company and each week's pick in the portfolio manager and follow them to determine when and if I might like to get this pick.  
Maybe it's on the way up to higher heights and I can still get on the train.  
Anyway, it's good to take a look at these as well.



STOCK SCREEN

There is an article on this site entitled "Value Stocks for Contrarians."  
This article reveals results of a research that was done of their database for "issues whose P/E ratios on estimated 2,000 earnings of 15 or less, whose five year projected earnings growth rate exceeds 10%, and whose five year projected earnings growth rates are higher than the P/E ratios."  
They were also screened for S and P five star ranking, which means the S and P analysts recommends these companies as buys.  
Ten stocks emerged.  
These stocks can be followed in the portfolio manager (they have a great one, by the way) to determine if the analysts are right and if you should in fact buy.


I could spend time going on and on about these site, but I do think it is noteworthy to at least put down brief statements about the other two areas that I believe could be useful in helping to select the next big stock of the year and that was the IPO section.  
The IPO is one of the most thorough and easiest to understand that I have ever seen.  
The company offered many IPOs last year and if we had just bought a few of those, we would be making great profits.  
The ones they offered were UPS, eBay, and FTD, all winners right now in the market.  
So you see, it is entirely possible to use this site as a tool to help you find the next Stock pick of the year....I will definitely be using this site in my daily research.  
May you reach the highest heights in your trading ventures.

		First of all, I only gave UOP a "1" because there was a "0" as an option. 
The experience at UOP has been nothing but a hassle. 
The staff is extremely unprofessional and unorganized. 
My story is one that has probably happened to other people, and it involves financial aid, or lack there of. 
I recently left the military and began using my G.I Bill for college. 
When I enrolled, I opted to use my military money to pay for classes, but signed up for financial aid to defer the payment until my G.I. Bill took affect. 
When my government money began to come in, I called the university to see what needed to be done. 
I was told multiple times that because I was approved for aid through the university, the G.I. Bill money was mine to keep for personal use, and I was covered for eight classes. 
After being told this several times, I thought that things were in order. 
WRONG! 
I was recently handed a bill of almost $6,000.00. 
The woman responsible for this was apparently discharged from the university, but they will not take the hit for this terrible mistake. 
So, after hearing negative stories about some of their programs not being accredited, and actually reading on the internet that they do not offer accredited online courses, degrees, or programs, this has shown me that the University of Phoenix is nothing more than a criminal hoax. 
Everyone, do yourselves a favor and do not even entertain the thought of attending this apparent college.

            E*trade offers many different choices for signup benefits, but are they worth it in the long run? 
Competing companies may provide better service, features, or even prices, except for maybe the money market fund interest rates that E*trade provides.




Before you read, please keep in mind what you think about this review so you may vote on what you think about it after you read it.

Thanks.


I've just recently decided to swim my way into the ocean of online stock brokerages, in hopes of finding one that will provide low commissions-per-trade, good trading speed, as well as after hours trading. 
You see, I don't have very much to invest (a couple grand) and every commission means more money out of my pocket. 
I'll probably be doing a little bit of daytrading to make some quick cash, so as you might expect, many orders in succession can quickly build up commission fees.


the research.

I took a look around the online brokerage industry, to see some investing brokerages which were near-unsupported, some which provided barebones, low-priced trades, but not much else, and some near-full-service firms which were way out of my prospective price range. 
Then i stumbled upon the 3 companies which seemed like an attractive offering: Ameritrade, E*trade, and Datek. 


The companies.

Ameritrade seemed to offer some good benefits for signing up, and relatively low commissions, but they just seemed to be lacking a bit in the features area. 
I don't believe they offer full after-hours trading, which was a bit of a turn-off. 
Now, E*trade was a company I had been considering for some time, since they're one of the 'big players' in the industry. 
They offered a $75 bonus for signing up, which seemed like a good excuse for me to whip out my checkbook right there. 
However, I stopped myself in my tracks once I saw Datek. 


Datek vs. 
E*trade. 
Let's get it on.

Datek offered me 10 dollar commissions on limit orders. 
Wow. 
E*trade offers twice that for limit orders- 20 whole dollars. 
Datek also includes a 60 second guarantee for trades, or the commission is free. 
I figured that the sort of service they provide is only something I could only expect from a high-quality brokerage. 
E*trade's signup bonus was starting to look not as grand, in the big picture of things.


The result.

I received a promotion from Datek in the mail recently, which offered me 10 commission-free trades for signing up. 
Needless to say, that offer made my choice a lot easier. 
Datek is now my single investment brokerage, and while I can't trust that the customer service or speed will be any better than E*trade's, I can rest knowing that I'll be paying a heck of a lot less than I would've had I opened an account with a different company, and have more features I could only expect from Datek. 
Limit orders are my preference, since I like to be careful with my money. 
Datek offers half the price that E*trade offers on limit orders, which will surely save me a lot of money over time.




P.S. 
This is VERY IMPORTANT! 
Tell me what you think about this review: vote to the right. 
This will give me some feedback so I can write even better reviews in the future.

## Topic: Increase the Communication in Your Group
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I ran into eCircles when I was looking into ways of improving communications in one of my organizations. eCircles is an Internet page that allows you to create and join communities that share your interests. 
While places like Excite and Yahoo! 
have attempted to create sites like this, eCircles has perfected it with creating a visually stimulating interface.


Let me tell you a little about eCircles. 
With the Internet site you can create a group for your Boy Scout Troop (just as an example). 
Let's say that the troop is very busy and has a lot of activities planned. 
Well, you have a calendar where you can input the events and any person can view the calendar and check out the events. 
In addition, you have message boards so that you discuss various different topics. 
You can also send e-mail to all members in the group just like OneList does. 
There are also capabilities for file sharing, photo sharing, and live discussions.


The reason why I say this is a visually stimulating site is because the site has a good color scheme. 
If is very easy on the eyes and easy to identify the navigation system. 
In many of the other community pages, you have a white screen with links all over the page. eCircles seems to organize the topics better which makes it a better system. 
In addition, for each of your groups (you can belong to more than one) you can have a different character represent you. 
The default is a smiley face, but I changed mine to Darth Vader (I am a nice guy though).


I do have a few complaints about this site. 
The main one is that the calendar does not support repeating events. 
Let's say that our Boy Scout Troop has a meeting every Wednesday at 8:00 PM. 
I would like to put this in the calendar to remind everyone. 
However, in some calendar programs I can say that the event occurs every week and therefore do not have to input the event every time. eCircles does not offer this, so it makes the calendar a little weaker of a utility. 
I also think they should offer an e-mail system just in case people would like to use it.


There are other features including in eCircles like games, wish list, and other items, but they are not significant to me. 
You can also make a contact list, but without the e-mail, I see no reason for using it.


In closing, eCircles is a great place to keep group communications. 
It is very easy to use, and has a nice interface. 
If you can persuade all your members to bookmark this site and check it often, it is a good way to keep touch.

## Topic: Not necessarily *the* best, but much better than most all else.
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I should start out by stating that I have only used their investing side of things, and within that, only US equity markets (stock markets). 
ETrade offers more than just that, they have banking (which a friend has told me is quite good), and they have a lending section as well (which I have not ever even glanced at, so I have no clue there).


I should also note that the account that I use isn't mine. 
That probably sounds weird, but as a favor for a good friend, I trade his money and make him money. 
I like doing it, and he likes making money, so it all works out (my expertise is in programming, and I happen to be pretty good at programming code that does financial analysis on equity markets). 
When I eventually setup my own account, I would consider ETrade, but I am much more likely to use Interactive Brokers - they are much more suited to a daytrader or swing trader like myself.


All of that said, I will review what I like about the ETrade that I know and use.


I use "Power ETrade". 
The account was already setup for that when I started it, so I don't know exactly what that entails, but as I understand it once you make over a certain number of trades a month at their regular trading fee (which is $15 I think, or something around there), then you get bumped to "Power ETrade" and there are new options available to you.

I don't use any of those options that I know of, but I do get a $9.99 trading fee instead. 
Lower trading fees are always good. 
I believe most of the other options are real time data streaming and programs that you can install on your system for day trading type things. 
The account I use isn't a margin account, so I can't really day trade on it, so I don't bother with anything more than the normal trading interface and the "unrealized gains" view of the portfolio.


ETrade is laid out in a way that is easy to use and figure out. 
You can get to any section relatively quickly. 
There are slight quirks in the interface - such as when you are in the portfolio section, the only way to get to the trading screen is to select to buy/sell one of your holdings - or you have to go to the investing root node - you can't get right to a trading screen or the open orders screen.

If you are on a fast connection, this really doesn't matter at all since ETrade has fast loading pages. 
But on a slower connection this can be really aggravating if you are trying to get something done quickly.


I don't use the site for research, for real time quotes, or anything other than putting the trades through. 
As a result, there is a lot of extra stuff there that isn't needed. 

What is needed are low trading fees and fast execution times. 
The execution times are good. 
The trading interface is good and easy to understand. 
The pages load very quickly and are visually good enough.


One of the best features is that when doing TurboTax online, ETrade is one of the brokers that can automatically integrate to get the tax information.


ETrade is not the best for someone that just wants a good, fast, and cheap trading system.

But that isn't what they are claiming to be good at - they are a full service system that is supposed to be helpful to the uneducated investor as well.


As a result, I would say that it is better than average for trading, but really more suited to investing. 
You can get into mutual funds, bonds, options, stocks, and setup IRAs. 
It has full featured trading available, but a lot of it is add ons that you either pay to upgrade to, or you need to trade a lot to be offered.


My overall rating is that it is great for someone that likes to occasionally buy and sell some stocks (occasionally meaning maybe even as often as 3 times a month). 
But I still don't think it would be appropriate for a day trader - it would work, but you would be paying to much for all of the extra features that you don't need.

The class I just finished the instructor showed slides and then proceeded to just read them.

		What is UMUC's point in Europe? 
I surveyed the courses that start on Monday 23 AUG, and found many canceled, 1/3 to 2/3 at Army posts canceled or remain pending, while at Ramstein and Spang more are marked as'Go. 
Some posts have no courses marked 'Go'. 
Further, what is the point of a UMUC brochure listing courses, when they don't offer many new courses, or only a fraction of those listed in the brochure. 
It's the same courses, and the same professors adding little new to what they said last year, or the year before. 
It's the same planners in Heidelberg too. 
They say if you don't like what they offer go to DE. That's not a helpful solution. 
Nothing against DE for thoe who want it, but I'd like a classroom learning experience. 
I think both Army and Air Force folks here in Europe want better from the planners in Heidelberg (who probably should retire to make wayfor more innovative management). 
That's what people say here, and even the local ESO agrees. 
Get with it UMUC. 
You make a lot of money off of us, so start giving back some quality. 
And, by the way, the Army needs to get over the eArmy thing. 
Like UMUC, eArmy too seems like such a scam.

## Topic: If you ETRADE, you overpaid!

## Score: 2.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I have been an Etrade user for several years now, and years ago, $20 for a  trade was cheap, but now a wave of cut throat competition is here charging $10, $9, and $8. 
(Datek, Ameritrade, Suretrade) I am very unpleased with Etrade for multiple reason that have accumulated over the years. 
One constant is that Etrade has been slow loading, (which is why I've wanted to get DSL)

Here are a number of negative incidences I have had using Etrade.


A while ago, I accidently placed an order to buy 600 shares of something when I meant to sell my 600 shares. 
This order should not have gone through, because I did not have enough money to buy those shares, yet Etrade went ahead and executed the order. 
Etrade "loaned" me the money to buy the shares even though I did not enable margin; of course I was happy to get about 300 "free" shares. 
Then the share value dropped and Etrade notified me after a few month that I had to pay back the money they "lent" me. 
They even made me pay a fee FOR THEIR MISTAKE!


Another incident: one morning I placed an order to buy 300 Creative Labs at market. 
I could not get an order confirmation until about 30 minutes after the order had been placed and by then I have lost a few hundred dollars as the share price fell 2.


Yet another bad incident: I had 400 shares of Ubid and placed Good-Till-Canceled sell order at 34 5/8, and Etrade did not execute the order even though the high of the day was 35. 
I informed Etrade, but they responded with an impersonal block letter that claimed the bid price had not gone that high. 
Etrade can't fool me, they suck and they know it. they WERE a pioneer but now a LAGGARD.


Note: I still have an Etrade account while transferring my other to Datek, because I can get access to Baseline profiles, TSCM, and Briefing.com.


However, Datek is about as unreliable as Etrade, but they charge only half for the commissions.

## Topic: Email Lists at a Low, Low Price - They're Free!.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I didn't actually choose eGroups for my email list needs - I originally joined Onelist. 
Since then, Onelist and Egroups merged and there have been some changes, but I'm very pleased with the service, especially since it's free!


Online journals got me into Onelist's service. 
Hundreds of people keep their personal journals online, and reading them can be extremely addictive. 
Toward the end of 1998, online journallers started to create "notify lists" for the purpose of letting their readers know when new journal entries were posted. 
As I was one of those journallers at the time, I can testify to the ego-building (or -crushing) power of knowing exactly how many people cared to know when my journal was updated. 
But notify lists are only one category of the many types of email lists you can join. 
The range of available list topics is very broad, so you can find an email group on just about any subject.


Being able to run an email list for free was excellent. 
Several options were provided. 
You could keep your list out of the main directory to control which people knew about it, or you could make it visible to everyone signed up with the service. 
You could set it up so that anyone could join automatically, or you could limit membership to people you had approved. 
Setting up a list was easy, and I remember being gleeful about the whole idea of having an email list all my own.


Now, with the eGroups service, all of those options are still available, along with tons of other options. 
[Many were also offered by Onelist, but I can't remember the details, so I'll just stick to talking about the ones that I know are there now.] 


Messages

Members of eGroups lists can get their messages in various ways. 
There's the regular email format, where each message sent to the list goes to you individually. 
There's the digest format, where all the day's emails are combined into one long email at the end of the day. 
It's also possible to read the messages online only, so they won't take up any space in your inbox - this way, you remain a member of the list and read the archives whenever you choose.


The owner of a list can decide to make messages moderated or unmoderated. 
Moderated messages have to be approved before they'll be sent out to the whole list, and unmoderated ones just go straight out to everyone. 
Moderating everyone can be useful in a contentious list, or a big pain in a very busy one. 
Luckily, eGroups allows you to choose to moderate individual list members, or even ban those complete freaks who don't belong on your list.


One complaint that a lot of people have about eGroups is that advertisements are inserted into the messages. 
I don't have a problem with that, because if it's free, I'm not going to whine about having to ignore a few ads. 
They do offer the option to pay a monthly fee for the privilege of not having to offend your eyes with advertisements, but I am not about that!


Interactivity

You can get to know your list members, or help them get to know each other, by using the lavish features provided for these purposes. 
You can set up polls to find out people's opinions on anything you like. 
The "shared files" feature lets you upload documents and pictures that can be perused by all the list members, and if you like you can set it up so that anyone on the list can upload files. 
There's a calendar for listing events, and there are places for links and a list database. 
There's also a chat feature, in case you want to pick a time to mingle with all of your list buddies at once.


In case managing a list by yourself seems like too daunting a task, there is also an option to make other members list moderators. 
You can give them the power to control anything, or limit their powers to only a few areas.


Conclusion

I really haven't had any bad experiences with eGroups. 
Occasionally there's a period of scheduled maintenance, when no email goes through - but they always send a note to list moderators ahead of time, to let them know. 
The moderators can choose to alert their lists if they think it's necessary. 
I'm trying to think of anything negative about this service, but nothing is occurring to me. 
I'd definitely recommend using eGroups. 
I haven't had any reason to even evaluate other free email list services.

		I am currently enrolled in CTU. 
I had attended Fresno State University and being a mother of two it was very difficult to attend on time every day. 
I found CTU as a great alternative. 
If you don't mind the cost of tuition, it is a bit pricey and take into consideration, if you are used to receiving a generous financial aid payout, be prepared, financial aid, i.e pell grant and student loans, will be all absorbed by CTU. 
I qualify for the maximum financial aid, so I receive pell grant and student loans for the amount of $14,791 just $250 shy of the tuition for the year. 
(Thank goodness I only need 15 months of school to receive my bachelor's degree). 
I pocketed around $6600 from my financial aid and student loans per semester at Fresno State and it was great but I had to ATTEND school everyday and it was getting to be impossible with my children. 
My son is in elementary school but I was having to pay $400 a month for daycare for my 2 year old daughter at the time. 
I still received quite a bit after that $6600 minus $1600 but it is still so much better to be able to attend classes online. 
Just keep in mind that you will not receive any extra money from financial aid. 
I had to learn the hard way, going through the acceptance process and filling out paperwork and getting excited about being excepted. 
In the long run it will be worth it. 
You can earn your degree in 15-18 months and that is much better then 3-5 years attending a university. 
The other people rated this school a 0 or a 1, but keep in mind, there are 3 people rating this school (four if you want to count me) but in April 2005 alone there were over 96,000 students attending CTU online. 
I will not be able to vouch for the computer programming students, I am taking Business Marketing, but stay tuned, I will let you know how I rate this school after a few months of my business training. 
P.S. I searched the Better Business Bureau and in the past 3 years there were only 12 complaints (I think 12) and out of 96,000 plus per QUARTER, that is a very good standing, so keep these things in mind when making your decision.

## Topic: Merger is a good thing.
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            The recent merger of eGroups and ONElist has created a much better service than was available before. 
Now, both services offer the same service for the same great price--free! 
Apart from a few small delays while the two databases were merged, the service has continued perfectly. 
Anyone can have their own mailing list setup within 5 minutes.


I personally use eGroups to run my journal's notification list--it's a small group, but the service is still remarkable. 
I've used their technical support once or twice, and they have been responsive and helpful, and got a list back up and running within a couple of hours.


I'm also a subscriber to several much larger lists (300+ people), and they have been running smoothly since I have joined. 
Some of the lists that I'm on are extremely high volume (5-100+ messages per day), and they still distribute messages almost instantaneously.


The service supports many different types of lists--announcement, discussion, or moderated--and it supports each of them extremely well. 
Try eGroups today, and you'll never go back :)

		I am a Ph.D student in the school of education with an emphasis in teaching and learning at Capella. 
I am in my dissertation, having completed some very extensive work in each course (including much effort in my research papers for each class and very difficult comps, both written and oral)I have found the coursework, comps, and colloquia very rewarding and challenging. 
Anyone wanting to just sit through a degree without having to get involved can attend any traditional institution, but with Capella and her sister school Univ. 
of Phoenix, one has to be involved in a continuous manner, as every learner has to complete the very extensive research papers, to accomplish what face-to-face traditional institutions do not do. 
I have attend both, and will never attend a traditional institution again. 
Online and Capella are definitely for those requiring a quality learning experience.

            I'm a member of several E-groups.  
They keep me informed of various events and new information.  
Being a full time Mom and Student leaves me little time for research on different subjects for my classes.  
Some of the writer's egroups send their members list of links that can be visited at our leisure.


The fact that you can meet people from all over the world while sitting at home amazes me.  
You are allowed to ask them questions and answer any they have.  
Therefore, you can gain a lot of information about from new friends. 
Be careful to screen your messages.  
Many will just be gossiping. 
Chose wisely when looking at a egroup to join.


In one of the egroups I'm involved in, we have a variety of members that are in the writing business.  
They are all at various stages in the writing world.  
Some of the members are well published authors, while others write for only there personal needs.  
It, also, has members that are in other areas of the writing business such as Literary Agents and Publishers.  


There are so many egroups dealing with different topics of interest to list in one article here.  
I feel that if you do your research on the egroups, asking lots of questions of the moderator, then you can definitely benefit from them.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Egroups (formerly known as onelist) is a great website service invention!  
It's a wonderful place to meet people with all kinds of interests.  
And the best thing, it's all FREE!


Just sign up with a very, very short registration form.  
Then think of what topics you would like to talk wth other people about or even learn about from other people.  
I'm currently on many personal sweeps, coupons and swap lists.  
I think they're great!


After you join a community or list of your choice then you can decide what delivery of the messages work for you.  
If your like me then you want everything sent to your e-mail address as each e-mail is written from each person.  
Warning--- This can quickly take over your inbox if you don't check your mail often and your on a list with a high message rate.  
You can also decide to receive an archive of messages from each day all packed into one e-mail.  
This is really good for people that don't have a lot of time to keep up with their e-mail or just don't have that much space for e-mail.  
It's great!


This is a great place to meet people with your same interests and hobbies.  
It's also a lot of fun!  


You can even become your own list owner by creating your own list with your own rules and topics.  
Try it out, it's really neat to see all of the people coming in that enjoy the same things you do.


So get out there and join and egroup or two or three...

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            For those who do not know what egroup is, here is some information about this site.


www.egroups.com
This site is for those who want to join a group of people that have the same types of interests.  
There are many different groups you can join.  
The way it is set up is you can subscribe to as many different email groups as you want, but it is best to stick with 1 or 2 groups.  
Reason being that some groups can get rather large at times.


Once you become a member of egroups then you can start looking for the groups you want to join.  
If you are a member of Epinions.Com then there are many different reading groups you can join.


I have to say that when I first joined I had 3 groups that I was a member of, but soon found out that I couldn?
t keep up with all the email that was being sent to me, so I had to unsubscribe to two of the groups.  
Once you find the group you want to join then all you have to do is post a message along with your URL for the review that you are sending out to others to read.


One nice thing about being in a egroup is that some times you will find that there are others whom you don?
t yet have on your WOT and email alerts, so these people will also get a chance to read and rate your review as well as you rating and reading theirs.  


Being in a egroup is great sometimes, but you have to be willing to spend some extra time, cause you will get email notifications in your mail and then you have to read and rate those reviews that are sent too you.


One thing I have found out is not everyone will read or rate your review that you submit.  
I joined an egroup that had over 230 members in this group, I thought wow this will be great I will get many ?
hits? 
to my reviews.  
I soon found out this is not true.  
The reason I believe that not everyone will read or rate your review is due to the following reasons.

1.	
Don?
t have enough time
2.	
They forgot to un-subscribe to the group so they really are not actually posting reviews or reading and rating.
3.	
They look through all the reviews that are sent to them in the email and just read and rate those that they are interested in reading. 
(Sometimes we don?
t like to read reviews that we have no interest in.)
4.	
If you are not reading and rating other people?
s reviews then more then likely they will not read or rate your review in return.


Those are a few reasons as to why you may not get as many hits to your review as you think you should.


One important thing about this group is you are not entitled to read and rate everyone single review that comes to your email box.  
But if you don?
t feel you have enough time to read and rate the reviews that you get, then I would suggest maybe going to a egroup that has less members.


Things that are great about being a member of an egroup

1.	
Meeting new friends this is the best part of egroups.  
Meeting new friends is something that I?
m sure everyone loves to do, well if you are in an egroup then this is what you will get ?
new friends?.  


2.	
New reviews by others that you may not of met yet at Epinions.Com With the wide Varity of people who join an egroup you will find yourself reading reviews of members whom you never seen before, this is great cause it gives you the chance to see who this person is, and what type of things interest him/her.  
It will also give you the chance to add this person to your WOT.

3.	
You will get email notifications on a write-off that is going to be taken place and this will allow you to join in the write-off if you so choose to.  
You will get messages that are posted about some new things that are going on at Epinions.Com This will help you keep updated as well.

4.	
Last but not least it gives you more hits to your reviews then what you was getting before you joined.  
This will in return give you more money and also get your own reviews circulated into the community and let others be aware of whom you are.  


So in conclusion to this review I would suggest anyone who is wanting to get more hits on their reviews, or even anyone who wants to just read other members reviews and rate them then this would be the right place to go.  
There are also groups you can join that have nothing whatsoever to do with Epinions.Com those groups can be support groups or even people who want to just meet new friends.  
No matter what interest you have I?
m sure you will find the perfect group to join.  



Other services this site provides is the ?
chat? 
feature and you can also enter into the polls that are taken place at the time.

		I'm not an employer but if I were I don't think I would ever hire someone with an online degree. 
Getting an associates degree in two weeks and a bachelors in four doesn't seem to be a very quality education. 
Hope they don't offer doctorate degrees.

## Topic: What a facelift!!.

## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            First and foremost, let me say that I think Egroups/ONElist is the best email list server on the internet. 
It is easy to use, there are thousands of interesting email lists to join, and if you can't find a list that suits you, just start your own. 
I have made many great friends and helped my business expand because of Egroups/ONElist, and for that I am thankful.


However, there are a few minor issues that I find to be irritating:

1.  
BANNERS!  
Right about the time that Egroups and ONElist merged they decided to start putting banner ads on the emails that were sent in HTML format.  
This is not an issue for some people, and some lists do not have HTML content, but for those lists that allow email stationery, we have no choice in the matter but to receive the banners.  
This is not only annoying, but for some people it is downright expensive!  
The banners, which are attached to URL links, automatically bump some users online against their wishes, and for people that pay for their local telephone access, it hits them right in the pocketbook.  
The only way to stop getting the banners altogether is to make the lists plain text only, or to pay $60 to have them taken off.

2.  
When the merger happened, Egroups/ONElist made some changes in the way that they have the lists arranged.  
The old ONElist had them arranged so that lists were easy to find, and with minimal effort, you were on the list that you wanted.  
They also did away with their "most active" lists from each day.  
Personally, I really liked that feature, because when I go to look for another list to join, I want one that had LOTS of mail.  
Now I have to just guess.


All in all, Egroups/ONElist is still the best out there, but I would suggest that they put a few things back to the way that they used to be.

## Topic: Online Communities galore..
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
               Since the Internet's expansion began and it joined the mainstream (or was it the other way around?)
, ways were looked for so that many people could communicate with each other through e-mail; simple CC'ing (carbon copy, a feature that lets you send identical mails to more than one recipient at a time) was not nearly adequate for the purpose of new users added, old ones having the option to no longer receive mails from a list that outlived its usefulness for them, or anyone at all who wanted to have a historical view of everything sent, by thread or date.

   
The answer to this need was mailing list, and various Unix-based utilities were soon developed to fill in the niche; however, they were still somewhat difficult to use, text-based, and with too many parameters and options for the casual non-technical user.

   
Egroups is, of course, more than a simple web version of a mailing list. 
However, where it performs this particular task, it does so with great efficiency, reliability, and through an easy to follow Web interface.

   
Once you join for free, answering the (these days obligatory, but to a lesser extent than some sites out there) series of questions about yourself, you are ready to roll. 
There are literally hundreds of discussion lists you can enlist directly, dealing with pretty much everything under the sun, from playing online games on the Internet to tending to your garden, or criticizing a variety of books by theme, author, or book cover colour.

   
In addition, you can create a new discussion group within 5 minutes, customizable to the degree that you wish it - do you want everyone to be able to join it? 
Would you wish to authorize new additions to the list seperately, or just every mail they send seperately before it's posted? 
Or maybe just allow some recipients of your list the right to post freely, or even allow them to authorize new users altogether? 
There are virtually dozens of options and combinations to cover even the most demanding and specialized needs.

   
In order to participate in discussions, users may either simply use their e-mail clients, sending mails and replies to the address designated by the Egroups server, or log on the Web site itself and post or read older postings directly from its sleek interface - it is quite well designed to take you where you wish within a couple of clicks, even if are part of a dozen groups.

   
This is not to say there are no problems. 
Sometimes, e-mails take a couple of hours before they show up after they are sent (although usually they appear in your mailbox before a full minute passes); there are a couple of bugs as well, as for instance I found myself unable to remove my account from its administrator status flag on a group, while I had no problems doing so on a second one. 

   
The advertisements and banners are also at the top of every e-mail sent, instead of the bottom as in many other similar free services on the web, and that sometimes becomes a nuisance.

   
All in all, when it comes to online communities, this is a highly recommended site. 
It will do what you want it to, and it will rarely fail at its focal point. 
If you need e-mailing lists it can be your answer.

		I am 2/3's through my Masters program and find it very challenging but rewarding. 
There is a tremendous amount of work between the DQ's, individual projects and team projects. 
The simulations are great and other than one facilitator, I have been more than pleased. 
I have never worked so hard, the classes are really condensed into 6 weeks, and the evaluation is tough. 
Although the university requires participation 4 out of 7, the facilitators require content that show intellegent analysis. 
The individual projects, often based on simulations, are pertinent to the topic but require you to really think about handling situations. 
The team is as good as you make it. 
I have been in both good and bad. 
Mostly, I have found them rewarding but I always assume it is MY project, so am never disappointed. 
Only once did I complain to the facilitator - and I know for a fact the two individuals left on my team were penalized. 
I aced the class - but I did the whole paper. 
The materials are real world and relevant with significant opportunity to tie in your personal and work experiences. 
I have enjoyed the people I have gone to class with and although I have taken some breaks due to my employment reimbursement program - I am still in touch with several of prior classmates from around the GLOBE! 
It is what you make it. 
You must be very disciplined. 
As for financial aid, I have no experience with it. 
As for guidance - I have made my own decisions as to when to take a break and when I changed my major.

		I have over all been VERY impressed with CTU, I feel where people are messed up is when they try to rely on this degree to get them a job (putting in no effort), or they enroll with out ANY experience in the field. 
These same people dont know the basics of have to operate a computer. 
The one thing I wish is that CTU had a stricter acceptance policy. 
If someone cannot pass a basic computer navigation course, they cant enroll, or if they cant pass a simple pre-exam for their chosen degree they cant enroll.


If you dont know ANYTHING about the degree field you are wanting to go into, or you dont know ANYTHING about basic computer operations. 
DONT ENROLL.


90% of these negative reviews sound like people that are just pissed because they cant learn without having their hands held. 
This college is for people that are self motivated and WANT a degree, not for people that want to goof off and have the instructor remind them day after day what they need to do and walk then all the way through gradation.

## Topic: A Cute Community!

## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            This is a really fun place to build a community! 
One of the best features about eCircles is the character icons members select to represent themselves. 
When any member logs into eCircles, they get to see the "faces" of friends and family in their circle. 
It makes a very nice introduction to web communities for somebody who hasn't got much web experience. eCircles have a very friendly, homey atmosphere that all my members like.


These communities offer all the things the more commercial services like eGroups do: there is chat, file sharing, community calendars, and the like. eCircles makes things a little simpler to understand, though. 
For example, whereas an eGroups user has to know that photos, music and text or other files all go into the same files section, at eCircles, there are separate areas designated for each of these things. 


There is also a really nice function, added just recently, which helps members to plan events and collect info from RSVP's. 
A member planning a party can find out not only who will be attending, but how many guests, what food they plan to contribute, if they have any allergies, etc., etc. 
Questions are user defined, so they can be changed to suit the occasion.


There is also a wish list section where the guest of honour for a party can specify what they would like to receive. 
It works just like a store gift registry, and in fact allows members to buy items online at specific stores. 
Or they can simply tick off that they are buying the item, so it won't be duplicated.


The only thing lacking at eCircles until just recently was it didn't really work as a mailing list. 
There was the option to send mail to individuals or the whole group, and if respondants hit the "Reply to All" button when they wrote back everybody could be included in the discussion. 
Unfortunately that didn't leave the member with a choice to be included or not. 
Now, the discussion forum has been upgraded to include the possibility of sending out posts as email messages. 
Members can opt to receive these emails or not. 
And the really great bonus is that the choice can be made globally, or based on the subject matter of a conversation thread. 
If a particular thread isn't of interest to a member, he can simply opt out of that conversation!


My little group of students and extended family really enjoyed eCircles while we were small. 
As we got bigger, most of us got involved in an overlapping group I was running at eGroups, so we have mostly stopped using the eCircles site. 
I think if the upgrade to the discussion forum had come a little earlier, though, we would have opted for eCircles 100% rather than shifting over to eGroups.


The only complaint I've had at all was that the large amount of graphics made the pages slow to load, even at 56K. 
Our Mac users actually had trouble getting pages to load at all sometimes, though they found things worked better if they were using Explorer as a browser.


The technical support staff were very helpful with that problem. 
In fact, they were very attentive to our many suggestions and occasional problems over a period of several months. 
(Sometimes we were in daily communication with them, just making suggestions and asking questions about how things worked!) 
They definitely rate an A+ for service!


This is a great service for smaller communities, and also for groups that are very active offline. 
The circles can be organized along the lines of family, friends, school groups, community groups, special occasions like an upcoming wedding, etc. 
Each category comes with a different little icon, and all a members' groups and their icons are displayed in a circle formation at login. 
The concept is really cute!

## Topic: Why You Should Avoid Online Brokers
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I may be a little biased since I am a stock broker with a big wall street firm, but most people should avoid online brokers for a number of reasons. 
Please read on and do not dismiss my opinion because you have had success trading your account.


First of all, the e-brokers do not provide any extras.  
Check out you money market rates with your e-broker.  
Around 2-2.5%?  
They should be over 5% right now.  
Ever needed documents from your e-broker?  
What did it cost you?  
If the answer is anything, you are being cheated.  
Ever needed to talk with a human?  
How long did it take?  
The answer should be a few minutes or less.  


Secondly, sure you have beaten the markets for the last few years.  
Let me guess, you trade tech stocks and buy on margin.  
Or maybe you are fully invested in tech.  
Congratulations!  
You have had a wonderful few years.  
Will it continue?  
Not likely!  
I am bullish long term, but let's face it-  tech stocks have to take a breather at some point. 
Many of you will get drubbed when that happens.  
What happens if we go into an extended bear market?  
I know, don't sweat it, right?  
I would like to see how cool you will be after three years of negative returns.


What about advice?  
I know, you do not need it!  
You have trounced the averages over the years!  
But, I assure you the day will come when the bear market sets in.  
You may get it right before any of the analysts, but you also may make a dumb move that costs you a lot of money.  


SO what is my advice?  
Open your online account with one of the traditional players- MSDW or Merrill.  
With an MSDW account you can do your own trades for $29 or talk with an advisor and do the trade for $39. 
I would also be willing to bet that your execution is better since the big boys do not pay for order flow like the smaller niche players do. 
Consider it.  
At some point you will probably be owned by own of the big boys, anyway.

		ACTUAL Rating 2.5 - An honest review from a graduate

Today is my last day of class with UOP Online and I will finally have my bachelors. 
If you are cosidering attending UOP Online you should read this.


During my 5 year treck to obtain my degree, I have attended UOP Online and my local community college both at the school and some online classes.


First UOP has the online learning down pretty good compared to my local community college. 
They no longer use outlook express (which wasn't bad in the first place) but now have an "ok" web interface.


The electronic books you are forced to purchase are way over priced and very hard to use effectively.


The quality of education you receive REALLY depends on what you put into it. 
You can learn a lot from UOP Online if you put in the effort. 
However, my big gripe is that if you don't put in the effort, you can still pass. 
I was out of UOP Online for a year while I attended my local community college to save some money. 
When I came back I just happened to get into a class with a lady that I had major problems with in previous classes. 
She basically didn't do her work in the teams that UOP Online requires. 
Well she was still up to her old tricks: "Sorry I'm so late on doing my work, my DSL was out". 
She is only a few classes away from graduating.


UOP Online puts 30% of your grade on team assignments. 
These assignments are worthless past the first few classes. 
After that all you learn is that too many people don't do their work and you are required to pick up the slack. 
Trust me, I work in teams every day at work and these "team assignments" are nothing like the real world. 
What they do teach you is just how stressed out you can get every couple of weeks.


The cost of the education is expensive. 
However, on the other hand I would not have been able to complete my degree at all if I was forced to attend a brick and morter school because of my busy work schedule. 
It took me nearly a year and a half to get 9 credits from my local community college because I couldn't fit their schedule into mine. 
With UOP Online I work on my schedule which was the only reason I did it.


I never had real problems with the staff and they always did their jobs and always called back. 
On the other hand I never felt that UOP cared about anything other than my checkbook.


My biggest problem with UOP is not the staff, quality of education or price, it is the fact that they have turned the degree that I have worked so hard for into an almost embarrassment for me to admit to. 
Their years of spamming people and online ads on nearly every web site you vist have degraded the image of the University severely.


This site is full of disgruntled students and obvious UOP staff posting comments. 
Anyone that would rate UOP Online with 5 stars is not being truthful. 
On the other hand almost anyone that has legitmately attended the university and worked hard would not in good faith rate it a 1.

My advise? 
If you are young and just out of high school go to a traditional university. 
If you are like me (30 something) and need a degree and some education, UOP Online (or another online school) could be for you. 
But be careful with UOP Online, they have really given themselves a bad reputation and no amount of 5 start postings will make up for it.

		Many of you complaining about DeVry and some of you even think it is a scam. 
That is not true at all. 
As a matter of fact, it is not where you go it is how you apply yourself and make the most out of your learning experience. 
The same class (i.e computer class) being teach at Ivy League schools are being offered at DeVry. 
Many of you think that you can get a high paying job with a good GPA like 3.5 - 4.0 or going to a better known school? 
That is not true at all because I know peoples that went to top school in the nation like North Western and U OF C and they were struggling to find a job after graduation and in many cases they settled for a job that is not in their field. 
In a technical field, they required experience in addition to your degree. 
A degree is just a piece of paper like a passport to get you in the door but after that you must prove yourself after that. 
I interned for IT companies while going to DeVry and work as much as I can to get alot of experience in programming, networking and business throughout the entire 3 years. 
2 months before I graduated, I was offered job to Kanbay International, AllStates and IBM and their starting salary was around 65k (this is over 8 years ago). 
While some of the students who were graduated with distinction (3.9-4.0 GPA) can't find a job and have to settle for a less pay job starting at 50K. 
So, if any of you think that you can get a good job in technical field(s) with your degree by itself then you're wrong. 
Companies want experience workers and they will hire someone without a college degree even if you can prove that you had real working experience. 
Don't get too hang up about where you go to school. 
Apply yourself, be prepared for the real world by getting a job in the field that you're studying for and shoot for a B or better average in school and you will be fine.

## Topic: E-Trade Slime Story
## Score: 2.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            There are a couple of not-very-flattering facts that you should know about E-Trade. 
First of all, E-Trade values you at $400. 
That's right, a third party web-site or other business that refers a customer to E-Trade gets paid $400 per head that actually opens an account. 
But last week I heard an E-Trade radio ad that was offering two Tina Turner concert tickets for any new account that opens - and these are not $200 tickets, so E-Trade is pocketing the difference. 
So if you take these concert tickets, you are not getting a very good deal. 
And since the stock market values each customer of E-Trade at a much higher rate than $400 each, E-Trade benefits a heck of a lot more than you do when you open an account, even if they gave you the $400 directly.


Secondly, and more seriously, E-trade attempts to pick your pocket when you trade "penny" stocks. 
A friend of mine put in an order at the "ask" price on E-trade for a certain stock for 10,000 shares at $0.18 per share. 
This stock was on the OTC bulletin board, giving it a .OB ending on its trading symbol. 
Now if there was enough liquidity in this stock, it should have executed immediately. 
The order sat there for hours, nothing happened. 
After waiting and growing impatient with E-trade, my friend also placed an order with Schwab for the same $0.18 price for 2000 shares, and it executed immediately. 
He then did another trade on Schwab for the same ask price for 10,000 shares on this same stock, and the order was executed ten minutes later. 
The E-Trade order went the whole day unexecuted. 
He then called E-Trade to complain, and after getting through the usually busy phone line a customer service rep told him that "obviously the price never reached $0.18", which is strange thing to say since this was an "ask" price. 
When my friend "busted them" with the information that the identical Schwab order and other orders for that stock did execute that same day, the customer service rep had nothing intelligent to say. 
My friend believes that E-Trade is trying to collect some additional revenue from making a market for a bigger spread, but I do not know if this is true or not.


So E-Trade not only get a poor rating for customer service, they also seem to be looking for any way to skim a pick the pockets of its customers. 
My suggestion is to look at the recent Gomez Advisors brokerage survey before selecting an on-line stock broker, and avoid E-Trade altogether. 
If you do decide to sign up with E-Trade, insist that they put $400 in your cash account at minimum.

            eGroups.com....What else can I say?? 
There are so many lists to choose from. 
Something for everyone essentially. 
I wandered over when it was known as onelist. 
And found to my delight, scale model horses, shetland sheepdogs, homeschooling. 
Everything that I am interested in, or want to learn more about was there. 
Amazing! 
Easy to use, it keeps track of what lists you belong to, and what version of mail you get.Digest, for the busy person, condenses it into one big email every 25 messages or so. 
Individual, you get each individual posting per member (better have a lot of time for this one).No mail, in case you need to go away, and web page. 
Where you go to the site and read mail there.
  
Easy to send mail, participate in discussions, this is the list for me. 
When there are polls, they're easy to take part in as well. 
There are lists for children, as well as adults, so all ages can take part of this service. 
Some lists are small, some are huge. 
Yet you make good friends over the course of time,and have fun along the way!

## Topic: Merrill Lynch and E*Trade
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            
                                 Anyone who has an account with Merrill Lynch should
                                 re-evaluate. 
My experience suggest that ML's research has cost
                                 me a lot of hard earned dollars. 
They charge high commissions,
                                 give low service to students, and low asset based clients, and
                                 their research is mediocre. 
They charge me $35 to maintain an
                                 account. 
I recently transferred to Waterhouse Securities and
                                 E-Trade. 
They offer trades for $12, $14.95 respectively. 
Merrill
                                 Lynch brokers never called me over the last three years to
                                 evaluate my portfolio. 
And all of my selling and buying was done
                                 with my own research. 
                                 
Merrill Lynch never went to online trading quick enough. 
They
                                 have a bad attitude. 
And they charged me $50 to close my
                                 account. 
They need customer service enhancement.

                                 
It took me 3 months to transfer my assets. 
They will do
                                 everything possible to make transferring difficult and frustrating.
                                 
My advice: Write a letter to the CEO. 
And call your branch
                                 manager to facilitate the transfer. 

                                 
E-Trade and Waterhouse Securities are shaping the future of
                                 the brokerage service. 
Merrill Lynch no longer has the vision.
                                 
And I suggest you give up high commissions and the snobbish
                                 corporate attitude. 

                                 
But I don't speak for all the financial consultants and people at
                                 Merrill Lynch. 
I disagree with their service and fees. 
Many of the
                                 brokers are highly talented and they offer great resource for
                                 their clients. 
They would certainly be able to make it
                                 independently.


                                 
Pros:  On-Line Trading Gives You Control
                                 Cons:  Merrill Lynch has ultra high commissions, a poor attitude.

		I ranked in the middle but that's because I couldn't post without a ranking. 
I really have no ranking but just a word about tuition and those reviewers who use the "high-cost of tuition" as one of the reasons to avoid this school and other online institutions. 
Anyone who thinks that brick and mortar schools do not over-charge for education is living in a fantasy world. 
EVERY university charges more than the education given is worth. 
They are ALL businesses thinly disguised as higher-educational institutions and run to make a profit. 
That's not to say that some have the student's well being in mind and care about providing good education when they make their decisions, but every school has the same business model that charges a per credit price per course. 
Look at the way the 4 year degree is structured at any school. 
You have to have 120+ credits to complete most undergrad degree and only half of those credits are classes related to your major. 
Why not have an undergrad degree on just your major and only have to complete 60 credits? 
The reason given is a "we provide a well-rounded education" so you have to take two years of b-s, which really means, we get to charge you for those two years! 
It's the reason why I dropped out of college many years ago because I saw through the facade. 
If you're going to knock the school, provide real reasons backed up with verifiable proof. 
Don't just complain about the tuition costs, because you could pay much more elsewhere and receive a worse education all for a pretty name on a piece of paper.

		Yes, Getting Better, I found that also. 
This is the biggest reason I decided not to go to this school. 
When you want to advance your degree in Psychology, the internship and your placements are just as important as the schools curriculum (your Master's education). 
The reason why Capella falls short is because they ARE an online school. 
Their geographic location(centrality) leaves you to find your own mentors/internship which can be very challenging for the average student. 
Most of the local schools have first dibs on these internship positions. 
If your going to get an advanced degree in Psychology then you should go to a college that is local rather than online. 
Think about it! 
Applied psych has a relational component to it that you don't get that with most online schools. 
The closest school that I have checked out that had a great online program for LMHC was down in Florida and this is because you are mentored online in real time. 
This is the way to do it but still you have to find your own internship.
There is also a website the link is: http://www.capellafacts.org/capella_university_reviews.html 
And to give an answer back to lifeisgoodoutthere which has since been erased, I find it hard to believe that someone would go through all the work to put together a site like this and not have had a very bad experience. 
Its possible though not probable. 
So I am going to look further into it and come back on this site and let everyone know what I've found out. 
The BBB is a bad place for you to cite because most students wouldn't dream of going there to submit a complaint. 
Thats what these sites are for. 
Furthermore, if Capella is suing this person and he is lying then he gets what he deserves BUT if he is telling the truth, you can't sue someone for telling the truth or even telling their perspective unless they are malicious and thats hard to prove!. 
The best defense against liable is the truth. 
The Supreme Court continues to uphold free speech rights. 
There was a case on Angies list where a contractor was not getting work because raters were bad mouthing him so he took the owner of Angies list to court. 
They ruled in her favor. 
Besides, this guy did do bad work, he was good at selling himself but bad when it came to deliver. 
This is no different for Capella or any other institution of higher education. 
Why should you be rewarded when you deliver a bad product? 
No one out there should be afraid to tell the truth or let themselves be intimidated not to. 
If you are practicing bad business tactics then shape up because your going to lose business because of it, no matter how much people like you try to stop it.

            I've been using eGroups/Onelist for almost two years now, and I have had very few problems with their services.  
I tried listbot and topica, but eGroups has taken the medal in my mind. 
Not only is your list an email list, its an entire community.  
You can share files, databases, links, and special days; you can also pose polls to spark conversation and schedule chats with the list. 
I haven?
t used the chats myself, but from word-of-mouth I know that their chat servers are very reliable.  
No matter what your list needs are, eGroups is the one to go with. 
And now since they've merged with Onelist, there's even more communities to join.

            This is a revision to my original Epinion, which was less than positive itself, about E*Trade. 
I have since then had cause to cancel my account and contact a lawyer for help getting out of the trouble E*Trade got me into. 
To put it briefly: E*Trade never notified me of a problem accessing my bank account for funds. 


They sent me receipts for stocks I'd bought, but then, without notification, cancelled my account and liquidated my stocks. 
Their documentation claimed they would contact me by phone with any problems, but they never did. 


The only notice I could possibly had received would have been by digging through several pages on their extremely confusing site to find my "current alerts" listing. 
Buried in that list was a notice about the funding problem. 


I am now in big trouble, having lost not only the hundreds of dollars in profits I thought I was making, but the IRA I thought was sheltering me from taxes. 
I declared to the IRS a $2000 tax-shelter IRA which has now been blanked from existence. 


Now I must make it up to the IRS, all because E*Trade would not email or telephone me. 
Worse, they sent me receipts by mail, as if everything were cool. 
It most definitely was not. 


I fully intend to sue E*Trade for the profits lost and the taxes I'll now have to pay because of their conflicting communications. their customer service was no help in resolving this. 
I had to go to them every step of the way to find out what had happened and why I no longer held any stocks. 
E*Trade, in my opinion, is a pathetic operation that relies too much on their site (which is the most complex interface I've ever seen) and not enough on service. 
If they can send me spam, why can't they send me an email telling me my funds never got through? 
Their "10-minute online IRA" sucked me in but boy do I regret it now. 
I should have known it was too good to be true.


In addition to my specific problems with E*Trade, I just think their site stinks. 
They have so much built into one interface that it's nearly impossible to navigate. 
Clearly, from what I described above, it's not very adept at personalization and notification. 
If you are a beginner, hoping to participate in the stock market with ease: forget it. 
Find another provider. 
E*Trade has got all kinds of banking, securities, stocks, markets, and research all crammed together. 
There's very little in the way of: "How much money do I have?" 
"What stocks do I own?" 
"Can you graph my portfolio?" 
Yahoo!'
s stock tracking tools are much simpler and clearer.


I have to give E*Trade the lowest rating in the book. 
They are unprofessional, unconcerned, their consumer offering is adulterated by the complexity of their advanced and business offerings. 
If you're looking for a partner to help you get started, find someone else. 


Following is my original Epinion, describing the setup process:

This is not a comprehensive review, but does reflect something of Etrade's quality of service and technology.


I tried to apply for an IRA online, a process which their homepage promised I could complete in 10 minutes, complete with funding my account direct from my bank account. 


So I entered all my info, filling out about 10 pages of web forms, and then hit "ENTER" only to be greeted with the following mysterious page:

"We have detetcted a problem in receiving information from your browser. 
Please close your other browsers and begin your application again."


Well, I tried it a second time, in Netscape instead of Exporer, only to be greeted by the SAME ANNOYING MESSAGE at the end of the process. 
What a hassle!


Personally, I don't have time to waste on this kind of garbage. 
You may have better luck, and perhaps this problem is isolated in their IRA application, but my first impression is resoundingly negative, especially because the error page didn't offer me any information on how to fix the problem, or its nature.

		I can not say that I have experienced the issues outlined by rootcrontab. 
Connectivity has not been an issue. 
University of Pheonix Online has provided a reliable classroom environment. 
The material is challenging and learning environment is unique. 
I am pleased with my overall experience with UOP. ------------------------------ To SEANOS: I am entering my final class for my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems with UOP. 
The experience has been a positive one. 
The environment is certainly different from an actual classroom in that most, if not all, communication is conducted online. 
Many will argue that you miss out on the social interaction. 
I say that by the time you reach college, your social skills should already be developed and the focus should be on training you can actually use. 
In this day and age computer skills and the ability to communicate using the technology available is a necessity in the corporate world. 
UOP provides a solid education and forces students to develop a sound understanding of computer technologies. 
I am a firm believer in UOP and online learning. 
Dont be fooled by what others may claim. 
Online learning is not a cakewalk. 
It takes hardwork and focus to stay on course but the results are extremely rewarding.

		I'm a current student of UOP. 
I think that if some one ask me "Are you here for a diploma?" 
my answer is "YES". 
I'm finishing my BSIT, and after talking to dozen of friends and other professionals that are in the IT industry, the diploma is all you need to get the opportunity to sit with an HR and have an interview. 
99% of all professionals told me that 99% of the times, experience is key to get a job in IT. Besides, every IT company that hires fresh out of collage IT graduates as soon as the hiring happens, the person gets send to training on what the job for the person will be. 
Regarding learning, you learn if you do your work. 
I can sit around and make excuses all the time and have other people do the work, but I opt to do the reading and to participate to learn basic skills. 
What collage teach you technical skills from top to buttom? 
If you're in one, you should be call a technician, not a college graduate. 
Collage will teach the basics and the roots people need to understand to then take more specific training ( by the company) on the actual work to be performed. 
I don't think UOP should be deminish because of some people that think they're the smartest people on earth, nor for people that didn't appreciate the value of going to school and earn a bachelor's degree from the conform of the home with flexible schedule. 
For those that don't like UOP, think the following: The next time you sit on a nice office making 50K or more because of the UOP degree you have stock on the wall, and 10% of what you do is what UOP gave you in education and 90% comes from the employer trainning, but your employer wouldn't hire you without that diploma you have on the wall, think again what your opinion of UOP will be.

		Mary E. Peters
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION (University of Phoenix Grad)
 Mary E. Peters was nominated by President George W. Bush on September 5, 2006, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the 15th Secretary of Transportation on September 30, 2006, after spending more than two decades crafting solutions to our nation's toughest transportation challenges.


Secretary Peters brings a unique perspective to her role as the nations transportation chief, having spent her career working on transportation issues in the private and public sectors, including leading both federal and state transportation agencies. 
This hands-on experience allows her to understand and appreciate the real-life aspects of planning, building and operating transportation systems on local, regional and state levels.


Over her 20-plus years in transportation, Secretary Peters has earned a solid reputation as an innovative problem solver, a force for safety and a strong advocate for effective use of taxpayer dollars. 
As Secretary of Transportation, she intends to use these same skills to tackle todays most pressing challenges including fighting congestion across all modes of transportation, improving safety and addressing strains on traditional sources of transportation funding.


She is responsible for maintaining a safe, reliable and efficient transportation system, while leading an agency with almost 60,000 employees and a $61.6 billion budget that oversees air, maritime and surface transportation missions.


Prior to joining President Bushs Cabinet, Peters worked in Phoenix, AZ, as the national director for transportation policy and consulting at HDR, Inc., a major engineering firm. 
She was responsible for building a management consulting practice and formulating public policy initiatives for the firm's transportation program.


In 2001, the President asked Peters to lead the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 
As FHWA Administrator from 2001 to 2005, she placed special emphasis on finding new ways to invest in road and bridge construction, including innovative public-private partnerships that help build roads faster and at less expense. 
She also was a strong advocate for using new technology to reduce construction time, saving taxpayer money and resulting in safer, longer-lasting roads and highways.


From 1985 to 2001, she served in the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). 
During her tenure, Peters worked her way up through the ranks as a contract administrator, deputy director for administration, and deputy director. 
In 1998, then-Governor Jane Hull appointed her director of the agency. 
While in office, she was recognized as the Most Influential Person in Arizona Transportation by the Arizona Business Journal.


Secretary Peters received the 2004 National Woman of the Year Award from the Womens Transportation Seminar, a national organization of transportation professionals. 
She chaired the Standing Committee on Planning and the Asset Management Task Force for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and was a member of the AASHTO 2001 Reauthorization Steering Committee.


A fourth-generation Arizonan and an avid motorcyclist, Secretary Peters holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Phoenix and attended Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government Program for State and Local Government Executives. 
She and her husband, Terry, have three grown children, and five grandchildren.


Let this soak in to all who doubt the school!!!!

		## URL: http://www.epinions.com/content_7229640324.
## Topic: more than just a mailing list.
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Introduction

With Yahoo! 
Groups (formerly known as eGroups), anyone can have a mailing list.  
I?
ve been using Yahoo! 
Groups since it was Onelist.  
I think that the two mergers within the last year or two (Onelist to eGroups, eGroups to Yahoo! 
Groups) that this company went through were beneficial to both the users and the company itself.  
Becoming eGroups, they acquired an overall better layout, and it became easier to use.  
While they have only been under the name of Yahoo! 
Groups for a short while, I think it should prove to expand the amount of users it has by quite a few, making it the largest free mailing list service out there.  


Finding a Group

Within Yahoo Groups, there is a group for almost every topic imaginable.  
If you can?
t find the group you?
re looking for, start your own!  
It?
s that easy.  
Getting people to join your group is the hard part.  
(I should know).  
Back to finding groups.  
All you have to do is search for a topic.  
Say you want to join a group about Playstation 2.  
You are bound to find anywhere from 50 ? 
100 groups.  
The hardest part is finding the group you want to join.  
You may have to weed through various groups, some in different languages and various sub topics, before you find one to your liking.  
Here?
s a tip: take a look at the groups with high member counts, like over 100.  
They usually prove to have the best discussions, if they are properly moderated.  
Absence of a good moderator is a recipe for disaster.


Creating a Group

Getting your own group started is a snap.  
All you have to do is create a unique name for the group, and set various settings such as the description, whether it will be moderated, unmoderated, or a newsletter, and a few other things.  
But let me tell you, if you aren?
t going to have the time to keep up with the list and moderate it, then I wouldn?
t suggest even creating a list.  
You still have to moderate it, regardless of whether you chose for it to be an unmoderated list or not.  
Things can get out of hand if you?
re not keeping an eye on things.  
I?
ve seen it happen on many groups.


Managing a Group

This is something that can get tough, if you?
re not ready for it.  
I manage a list of my own of around 160 people with a high amount of messages.  
It?
s a list about feral cats.  
One month it peaked at close to 2000(!) 
messages.   
I think that was the time that one (yes, one!) 
off topic message (a religious one) sprouted a whole argument that spread like wildfire.  
You know how heated things can get when you?
re talking about religion.  
Everyone has an opinion.  
That is why you have to keep an eye on the list.  
I did my best to calm it down, and eventually it did.  
I also manage another list of around 70 that, well, isn?
t even worth mentioning since it?
s quite inactive.  
That can happen as well.


Using Yahoo! 
Groups

Now that I?
ve explained most every general aspect, with exception to giving much mention to the ability to have a newsletter, I would now like to get into the insides of Yahoo Groups.  
Using Yahoo Groups is fairly simple.  
They have many features integrated into it, most of which have been around since the days of Onelist.  
Some of these features include posting pictures and files in your own folders on the website, adding links to a growing number in the Bookmarks section, creating a poll that is automatically sent to the list to view and respond to, creating a database to hold information and to add to anytime, chatting with other members in real time, and viewing the messages from the website.  


Sometimes these features can be restricted when the moderator (owner) chooses to allow only himself/herself or just the moderators to access these features.  
Yes, there can be more than one moderator.  
But the good part is when something is restricted, the moderator doesn?
t have to choose to restrict them all.  
He/She could choose to only restrict the database if he/she wanted to.  
Other restrictions include Members Only, and allowing anyone to view it (which technically isn?
t a restriction).


Most of these features are self explanatory, so I won?
t get into great detail about them all.  
I think the only thing the general user would not know much about is the database.  
They are really quite nifty.  
It?
s almost like a survey.  
For example, on my feral cats list, this is one of the databases:

What brand [of cat food] do you feed?

Where do you buy your cat food?

How much is it?

Comments on food:
Posted by:

These are written horizontally across the screen. 
Each member can post their own line of answers to these questions, and they can be edited at anytime, or deleted.  


Benefits of the Groups

Being involved in these groups, you can meet a lot of people.  
People you will have at least one thing in common with, which would usually be the topic of the group you are in.  
For a specific interest, you can find answers from experienced people if you are in the right group.  
You have a medical disorder that you believe no one around you understands?  
You can probably find a support group on there where people know what you're going through.


Conclusion

eGroups may have just started it's stay at Yahoo, but so far in the world of mergers, I really like what they have done to keep the users happy.  
They probably have things that some pay for mailing lists don't even have.  
I can't back that up with sufficient evidence, but I've been on non eGroups/Onelist/Yahoo! 
Groups that only offered the basics of receiving messages and message digests.  
I totally recommend this to anyone wanting to start a list/group, or looking for a group to join.

		Horrible experience! 
The learning groups mentioned by others are a nightmare if you end up with other members who show up at the 11th hour asking what they should do to contribute to a project that's been in the works for 4 weeks. 
I had unresponsive teachers including one who praised participants for the wallpaper they used in their postings but ignored the content. 
Extreme negative reviews of two classes including contact info to discuss were ignored by the administration. 
In my view the sole purpose of this institution is to collect (exorbitant) tuition.

		I had a nightmare with Capella University. 
They kept telling me that my loan had not been approved yet. 
Three weeks later, they sent me a bill for almost $2,000.00 
because I did not drop the course. 
I still have no clue what kind of nonsense is this. 
I will certainly sue them in federal court.

		I am a MBA student with 3 classes left. 
UOP teachers basically grade very easy and there are no tests. 
There are team papers for about 1/2 of the assignments and most of the students I worked with...I wonder how they graduated from high school. 
Papers are supposed to be written in APA format and many do not even know how to properly cite a reference. 
Basically an easy "A" and every class. 
It is a total joke of a school. 
You can learn (teach yourself) but you do not learn much from the students. 
Most do not read the weekly chapters and have little to add to discussions. 
There must be some kind of incentive for the teachers to give As. 
I took accounting and was lost through out most of the course because I found it difficult to teach it to myself. 
I got an A. Ridiculous. 
I am embarassed I go to UOP, but I came this far, I am going to finish. 
Good thing I work for the government...they take a degree for anywhere. 
I highly do NOT recommend UOP.

## Topic: Etrade or Etarded???

## Score: 2.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I have to admit Etrade is one of the better on-line brokerages available in the market today.  
However, there is one gripe that I have that I think everyone should know about.  


Before the griping though, let's talk about the positives:
1. 
The web site is very user friendly and contains a lot of great information 
2. 
The execution time for purchasing or selling a stock is fairly quick (based on my experience with them so far).
3. 
The promotions that they have (i.e. giving $75 to $100, depending when you signed up) is not too shabby either.
4. 
The research available once you open an account with them is very thorough.  
This alone is worth opening an account.


With all of the positive things that I just mentioned, you may ask why the negative title?  
Well?


For prospective account holders who want to speak w/ customer service folks, well, you may be out of luck.  


First, you'll have to dig layers after layers through the web site in order to find a phone number to call (The fastest way I think is to click on "help", then click on "contact us" next to estation).  


And if you're lucky enough to find the number, what you'll have to do next may be down right impossible: reaching a customer service person calling their number 1-800-STOCKS5.  


If you don't have an account with them, they'll make you press more buttons then you prefer to reach one of the "sacred" "service" reps.  
(The fastest way is to press "8").  
Then they make you wait forever, b/c they don't have enough reps working.  
The challenge isn't over.  


Once you get a hold of a service rep, what you'll discover is that they don't know much.  
On three occasions that I've called regarding some promotion or some question, the reps did not know there was a promotion or could not answer my questions.  
It was a joke.


I guess what I'm saying is that with all of the great things that Etrade offers, their customer service is just down right lousy.  
They lack the knowledge to answer prospective clients' questions and were not very courteous. 


I just wonder how these service reps will react if the market causes their systems to get real busy real fast.  
Will Etrade be able to handle the crisis?  
Even with all the great stuff that Etrade offers, I am considering changing brokerages now after my lousy experiences with the customer service folks.

		I think CTU is great! 
I love this school and I think that you all need to give this college credit. 
I've been attending CTU Online for 8 months and never had a mishap or complaint about it. 
I had never had a professor give me the answers and not make me work hard for my credits upon each class. 
It's not easy, it's actually harder. 
Try rasing 4 kids, working full-time and attending college full-time getting nearly 2 hours of sleep working my hardest. 
The nearest college is 2 hours away there and back a 4 hour drive. 
Thank God for online learning!I'm a single mother and, I am lucky to be here and have a great career opportunity because of being at CTU. Complain about something worthwhile, instead of trying to ruin the credibility of upstanding university that's been around for decades.

            I am a member of many groups and feel that they are the best way to meet like-minded people. 
I am also a moderator of several lists and feel that groups are the most organized, effective way to communicate with people all over the world who share similar interests. 

The best part is you send 1 e-mail that is sent to the entire group of people. 

My favorite groups are 

Harry Potter group where we discuss the book series Harry Potter and are currently anxiously awaiting the release of Harry Potter book 5, The order of the phoenix.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harrypotter

Crafty moms group where we share recipes, ideas, freebies and crafts.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crafty-moms

A Harry Potter The order of the Phoenix Spoilers list 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OotP-spoilers

and A mixed world where we discuss the state of the world and current events.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/amixedworld

I am a member of many others, but too many to list here. 
I just wanted to give you an idea of how diverse the groups are . 
They are the easiest way to communicate with multiple people online.

It is convenient.
However, it does make mistakes.
I buy and sell using paypal.
My annual sales are about $30,000.
However, when paypal makes a mistake.
buyer/seller beware.
For example, I just paid for an auction, and paypal's software returned an error message (3004) stating that it was unable to process the transaction, and "click here" to try again.
I "clicked here", and got the same error message again.
Then I checked my account and--you guessed it--I had paid twice.
Paypal's phone help told me there was nothing they could do.
And that was that.
Complete idiots if you need any help, even when it's their software that screws up.

		This is probably not the forum for my post but I have to react! 
Ugh! 
I'm so frustrated! 
I was reading a post about "for profit" schools! 
I don't attend any school right now and I happen to be shopping for a good MBA program. 
I read a post about the stigma online universities have and I want to say, BITE ME! Excuse me but what year is it? 
HELLO? 
Technology is the future. 
I don't know what I will do for my MBA but I have to say I was so angry when I was reading posts that dissed for profit schools. 
Frankly I think the teachers have more incentive and the staff is more student oriented when they know a profit is involved. 
DMV=non-profit snootie UNiversity SAME! Ugh. 
I'm so frustrated. 
Internet is the future people. 
This needs to be perfected and if your narrow views help so be it!

## Topic: I love it
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            summary
I used Datek back in the day (before it became ameritrad) and have been on etrade for a few years.  
I trade a good bit, sometimes nothing for a while and other times non-stop.  
I'm a power-e*trade customer, meaning I get to use the power e*trade application.  
From what I've seen this is the best combination of boutique level II market interfaces and large generic simple cheap brokerage interfaces.


background
As I see it, you have your traders who want a lot of non-trading tools - market research, expert opinions, historical data - and then your people who want trading tools - order routing, quick order entry, realtime market leaders etc.  
E*TradePro is definitely for the latter.  
That said, I find there are too many good free research tools out there to limit myself to any brokerage, so I'm not dependent on my trading company to handle research.  
Sure it's nice to get urgent news flashed to your screen, but for SEC filings and historical trends I could just as soon use yahoo (and I do).

On the flip side, the level II tools are generally intimidating for a novice.  
They usually charge a flat fee to trade with them, have penalties for light trading, always use a brand new proprietary interface you have to learn, and often seem like fly-by-night companies that you are supposed to use to toy with your life savings.


where e*trade comes in
ETPro has most of the speed and flexibility of a boutique trading application with the ease-of-use, assurance, and customer service of a more established firm.  
I found the application to be easy to use.  
Sure, it has some bugs, but they are consistent and there are few surprises.  
Uptime has been great on the service, and I find upgrades to usually bring features I had in mind - so it's clear they are listening to investors.  
Having the traditional web-based interface to back the service up ensures you can still monitor orders or trade if the application is down.

The web service is also fantastic for generating graphs of historical account performance, managing funds and, better yet, moving funds among accounts if you also bank with them.


customer service
Customer service is where I am most impressed with E*Trade.  
I can always get a human being very quickly.  
I'm also shocked at how knowledgable all the staff I've spoken with are.  
I've seen odd market behavior before, and ET is always willing to accept blame and make things right.  
I've also gotten in some of the most bizarre technicalities possible (name the violation - I've probably done it) and the customer service reps always shock me by understanding the situation and being able to fix it.   


conclusion
use it.  
It's great.  
No hidden fees either.  
Everything is as promised, customer service is great, and the organization is extremely professional.  
Innovation of a little guy with assurance of a big guy.

My husband and I both have accounts with Paypal, and both are very unsatisfied.
Unfortunately if you are a seller on Ebay, it is almost a requirement, if you want to attract buyers.
My husbands problems strted when all of the sudden Paypal decided to limit his account access.
he went to their resolution center, and followed the simple instructions, to verify his phone # and email.
he did this, Paypal then sent a letter, saying that they needed more info, and for him to complete more steps before the account would fully accessible again, the only reason they gave for this was that his account was connected to another email address.
he informed that there was no other email, address, to please tell him which address they were referring to, and to give him the steps to resolve this.
All they told him, was that they could give the email address, and he needed to resolve the issue with this "other" email.
Well, he is kind of stuck, I mean what is he supposed to do, he cant send or receive payments and has no way to figure out to solve this.
My problem started when I ordered some items from a website accepting paypal.
I mistakenly spent more money that was in my account, well this automatically takes money from your bank or credit card.
Paypal charged my bank account, but I did not have enough funds.
So, without my ever knowing, Paypal paid for these items for me.
I had no idea that they did this, I hab=ve never read or heard anything about it.
Well, now I owe Paypal this money, AND my bank because Paypal attempts to charge my bank account at LEAST twice a day, so my bank is charging overdraft fees, and paypal is charging, and this is just snowballing.
I contacted Paypal, explained all of this to them, that I was never informed that they would pay for my order, and that as long as they were charging my bank, I couldn't pay them, because I could never get caught up, due to NSF fees, etc..
Paypal basically said too bad, my bank can't put a stop on it, because it is not an acrual paper check, and they cannot access it, and since my bank account is now overdrawn, I cannot cancel this account.
I'm screwed as far as my bank and Ebay are concerned, and believe it or not, due to Paypal constantly tapping my account, I am now overdrawn in my account $1000!
Paypal is a ripoff, they do not inform of littel fees and services they provide,are not willing to work with you on problems, and obviously do not care about their customers.
Of course since EBAY owns Paypal, why does any of this surprise me?

Horrible experience with paypal.
Bought 6 guitars on ebay, purchased paypal's moneyback guarantee.
Guitars were of poor quality so I tried to send back.
Paypal instructs you to send to their P.O. box, which UPS and FedEx will not send to.
The package was too big to send with US mail.
Paypal informed me that the item was too big to qualify for their money back guarantee program even though they had offered it.
When I asked how was I to know without seeing the item if it was too big or not, they had no answer.
Their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered.
When I asked to speak to a supervisor they said they would have a manager contact me.
This consisted of a form email asking me to do the same paperwork I had already done.
I will never use their service again.
Buyer beware!

I've only recently opened a PayPal account, and so far I've been extremely satisfied.
The registration and confirmation of my information was easy and quick, and the service allows nearly instantaneous purchases of items over the internet.
Only time will tell if I run into any security issues.

## Topic: Etrade, Brokerage for the average active trader
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I have been with E-Trade since late 1997, so I have a bit of history with the firm. 
To put things in perspective, I also have an account with Datek and have used full service brokers before. 
I had originally joined Etrade because it was the best and first broker to really go online. 
At first, the services were great and the 19.95 a trade was a great feature since I was paying 50 at my old discount broker. 
However, as the site became more widespread, it became tougher to get through customer service, a must when their online order reporting became slow. 
This problem has since been alleviated. 


The following is a list of pros and cons that I have found with Etrade:

Pros:

Fast execution: I have two accounts, one with Datek and one with Etrade, and I sometimes place identical trades in both accounts. 
After having done this about 50 times, I have found that Etrade executes its orders much faster than Datek. 
In fact, only once has Etrade given a worst fill than Datek. 
This could just be luck of the draw, but in my opinion Etrade gives some great fills. 
Some may say that Etrade's execution is slow, however, most of them probably have not done simultaneous or near simultaneous trades through another online broker. 
I have and can attest by my account that Etrade is better. 


Customer Service: If you're an active trader, you get put into the Power Etrade program, which gives you the fastest customer service available anywhere. 
This is definitely a plus.


Access to IPOs: As an Etrade customer, you get access to some of the hottest ipos ever. 
Though the odds of getting them are low, it only takes 2 minutes to place an offer and if you hit a good one, you can be riding on triple digit first day returns.


Cons:

Price: The only setback that I can see for Etrade is the higher commissions that it charges. 
Versus Ameritrade and Datek, which charge 8 and 10 respectably, Etrade's 19.95 a trade can add up if you trade a lot.

However, this con can be substantially diminished by the faster executions which Etrade offers.


Lack of active after hours trading: Etrade has almost no liquidity for most secondary issues during after hours trading. 
This can be extremely frustrating when you want to buy or sell a stock before the market opens or after it closes.


Summary:

If you are looking for a regular online broker that allows you to invest/trade online with good executions, then Etrade is the broker for you. 
However, because of the lack of after hours trading, some more active traders may want to consider having a Datek online account just for that purpose.

		As the president of the ASB at the Long Beach campus I have had very many mixed feelings when it comes to DeVry... Im a 7th term Computer Engineering Technology major and I really think that devry has kind of gone through alot of problems ever since their "hay-day" back in the mid-late ninties...for any prospective students, here is my pro/con list for you: //----------------------------- // // PROS // //----------------------------- ---small class sizes, on the average your classes will have between 6 - 15 students... usually on the smaller side. 
that doesnt sound like much, but even if your professor sucks, at least hes only ten feet away rather than 400 in a lecture hall ---expedient education devry uses a trimester based system, which means that you only have 6 weeks off for the whole year; however, you graduate in three if you take the standard course load of 17.68 units per tri ---abet/tac accreditation devry has had accreditation for a long time now and here at the long beach campus, abet tac gave us the longest accreditation that they offer. 
---job placement i had two friends last semester that graduated with 3.5 and 3.9 and both were offered engineering positions that offered their starting pay at 50k and 65k respectively there are tons of jobs for us CET's and EET's...that if you work hard in them your looking at 6-figure salaries within 10 years easily //----------------------------- // // CONS // //----------------------------- ---bad profs while almost every school has em....we seem to draw them like flies. 
ive had well over half of my classes taught by completely ridiculous professors, some of which truly puzzled me as to how anyone in the world could actually hire this person ---incompetent administration sometimes i truly am amazed whenever i have to visit any of the various departments, particularly student finance. 
the experience that i have when i visit student finance is much like going to the dentist, except when i leave, nothing is ever fixed, and i am always angrier than when i entered. 
---business run academic institution alot of the decisions as to classes are made with a business mentality when they should be made with an educational one. 
course changes, student activites, even outsourcing the bookstore are all run with a business-like, bottom-line driven mentality ---the cost i dont even need to explain this one; however let me tell you that if you actually read the quarterly reports that are sent to devry's stakeholders, you will find the following in thier recent statistics: online, night time, and weekend enrollment is up 29% from last year while full-time day student enrollment is down porportionally. 
this tells us one of two things either students are switching from daytime to the others, or new students are coming as fast as the old ones are leaving. 
why would they do this? its MUCH cheaper to attend any other way than full-time mind you it will probably take 2 to 4 times longer to fulfill your degree requirements. 
//------------------------- // // Conclusion // //------------------------- DeVry is the school model of the future; for better or worse. 
DeVry educates over 200,000 people across the nation. 
DeVry started itself as a technical training facility for radio technicians in the 1930's. 
Many of the first courses taught were done so under "top secret" security clearances, and at the time were the most cutting edge training anyone could get. 
If DeVry is going to reclaim it's position as the best technical education out there, it MUST refocus its efforts back to its roots, and strengthen them with all of its force. 
DeVry must cut it's fluff....trim the fat! 
get rid of all the ridiculus programs that we have no facilities for; namely the GSP, HMIT, BMET, BMI, etc.etc. 
DeVry is a technical university and we have some of the best labs for CET, EET, ECT, even NCM students. 
We have the capability to become a great institution of HIGHER education, but only if we stop pandereing to the greed-filled marketing strategies of beurocratic buisinessmen!

		It is the absolute truth that school is what you make of it. 
I have been attending UOP for over a year now. 
First, I started in OH and then had to switch to IL when I moved to Chicago from Cincinnati. 
The students at the Dayton, OH campus left little to be desired and had no ambition and some because it was too challenging for them. 
Most of the students would drop to where my class sizes ranged from 3-5 persons. 
The faculty in OH was great and so was the administration. 
They were all very fair and very invloved with the student body and I am someone who got mostly B's and C's at first. 
I am very intelligent when it comes to Mythology and even after I worked my ass off with 2 and 3 papers a week, I still only earned a C.:) That was still my favorite class because of the challenge and I learned much more than I already had known...learning only one new thing is worth your money alone. 
The Chicago/Schaumburg classes are great! 
I have wonderful classmates that are actively involved, great instructors...for instance, one of my instructors had worked for NASA and one had worked for CIA several years before! 
I have little good to say about the administration here in IL as opposed to OH, but that is the trade-off. 
I do my work and work hard to get the grades that I do. 
The Learning Team concept can be challenging, but very rewarding...it teaches you the concept of reality...the life of hard knocks. 
If you can't motivate your teams, put extra effort to make up for the slackers in order to get your grade that you want, then how do you expect to get the career you want and be successful. 
It really sharpens your problem-solving skills, educates one on the powers of motivation and still makes you work hard as an individual. 
Those of you that think that a traditional University is better, than you are ridiculous!! First of all, I come from a very successful family. 
They all have stories and truths about students who fake their way through school even at the Universities that they attended which include, YALE, CORNELL and University of Illinois. 
It is because they have that accessibility to the student body. 
Next, I prefer to pay for my own education as an adult when I'm focussed and working at a real job. 
That means that I don't suck mommy and daddy dry to pay for the education while I cheat and sit on my ass, gossipping at the local Starbucks or putting on 50 lbs because I hit all the Sorrority/Fraternity parties that I can in 4 years!! 
Third, the world is changing over to modern technology...who do you think is going to have one up on the technology...it's part of the curriculum and with UOP having the largest student body, who do you think is eventually going to be looking over your resume's??? 
I can honestly tell anyone out there that I have been to a traditional University and MOST of the student body and faculty are superficial. 
Do you have professors that can first hand teach you about real life?? 
Do you have professors that have done anything other than teach class...for instance, that have worked for NASA? 
Probably not. 
Don't be so judgemental and stereoptypical because that is what will stand in your way of a real career before a degree from your school of choice will. 
The funny thing is that the people that work at this University in administration...that can't do their job right for anything(that means as easy as making a phone call) went to traditional Universities!!!!

		UoP sucks!!!!! 
They get your money and then screw you out of a real education. 
I made straight A's at UoP but the instructors I had for all my classes gave no feed back, no weekly grades(so you had no idea if you was actually learning the material correctly or not) and financial couslor was a joke! 
She would not return phone calls or emails. 
This college lacks too much to risk your hard earned money...find another college and seriously research them before joining!! To stanford: I made straight A's at UoP .. UoP's biggest problem is they are too big, hire instructors with full plates already to instruct, and lack financial aide that helps with book costs. 
Their program for financial aide is screwed up!!! AND I bet since you work at a hospital...you get employer repayment or at least half your tutition paid. 
A lot of people who haven't had the problems MOST of us have had....they were not fitting the entire bill therefore had no worries. 
But US who pay and work hard to get an education do find we expect MORE from a college whether online or not. 
I took on UoP knowing full well the work load would be heavy, but it was going to be well worth it for accomplishing my goals. 
So please do not say I or others did not have the abilities to complete our education. 
To UpsetStudent: I do agree with you .. UoP only sees potential students as $$$$$ and their programs stink!! Force you to take classes that do not need to be taken for you field.

It's a shame that a digital transaction can take a week or more...I could send a check in that time.
It takes up to 3 days to perform an *electronic* transfer of money into your PayPal account (explain that!), then that much time again to pay somebody.
PayPal claims that a deposit is dependent on the time frame of your bank.
And I understand that banks will delay transactions to eke out as much interest out of your deposits as possible.
Considering that PayPal is owned by the company that ran the online bank X.com, and operates PayPal as an interest-bearing cash account for you (and themselves), I wouldn't be surprised if they were party to the delays too.
I don't know whose fault it is or what causes it, but PayPal is a little overrated when it comes to conveniently paying people.

## Topic: New Look, What a Difference!.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Love to meet new people with the same interests as you? 
Well then you have come to the right place. 
I found eGroups over a year ago when it was still Onelist I started when I had recently been to an Alanis Morissette concert, and I was having so much fun. 
I was just searching through fan pages dedicated to Alanis Morisette and found the link, not knowing what it was I was getting myself into. 
I did not go out seeking a email list, but I'm glad I found it! 
Onelist connected me to a world of fans who gave me all the newest info on tour dates, new albums, downloads, pictures, and just about anything else a fan could ask for. 
I thought it was great then, connecting me to this world of people that I had so much in common with. 


One day I decided to do a little more exploring, to see what else I could find. 
I was amazed at the number of lists that were already out there. 
Anything from serious topics such as drug and alcohol abuse to making new friends lists. 
I was also surprised by how easy it was to start my own list. 
Any and everyone is allowed to start their own list with their own rules and topics. eGroups also allows you to post surveys, which can be a lot of fun for large active groups.


The new eGroups is a lot more aesthetically pleasing and makes it even easier for someone to find what they need. 
I did not think it could get any better, but I was wrong! 
At eGroups you have a number of options when you join a list, you can chose to have every email sent right to your email address, or have a daily digest sent, or even some lists allow you to go to the lists web address and read the emails there, and even reply there. 
They now even have a feature called eLerts that will notify you when a list has been formed with your interests in mind. 


One great thing I have been able to do is create a list called Aid4Teens that gives teens with emotional burdens a place to come and vent. 
We have been a great support system for each other and I truly think we have been a tremendous help to one other. 
We owe that to eGroups, letting me form a group like that. 


There are a few things I must warn people about though. 
Joining lists can be addictive, and after joining all kinds of clubs you might have a heart attack when checking your mail the next day. 
Sometimes you can have around 100 emails waiting for you. 
I've had to quit lists that just became to much to keep up with. 
You might also found the opposite, a list that you are really excited about joining ends up being a dud, no one emailing the list. 
Also you might find some hecklers in certain lists, you have to watch out for them. 
As long as you steer clear of them and lists that have them, you will have a great time. 
Enjoy yourself!

I have not had a problem with Paypal's service and have not had any problems with my payments.
Also, Paypal will investigate problems of undelivered auctions.
Twice I had to have Paypal investigate a seller I paid through them.
Both times it was for undelivered merchandise.
I reported the problem to Paypal and they did all the investigating and insured the seller refunded my money.
If you are buying at auctions sites I recommend Paypal because it is more secure and can investigate problem sellers.
Also, another bonus is paying by credit card through Paypal, because you also have the added protection offered through your credit card to investigate undelivered or damaged goods if Paypal could not rectify the problem.

            I have traditionally used Charles Schwab as the brick-and-mortar trade institution.  
Their services have been reliable and trustworthy.  
Last Christmas, when I was in Santa Clara's Micro Center, E-trade offered an unprecedented and irresistible $400 rebate if I signed up before January 23, 2000.  


The deal was that I pay up-front for the $400 value of goods at the local computer store and then I will get a credit in my E-trade account later, along with the $1000 minimum principal.  
For the offer to be valid, I have to maintain the account for one year.


After two weeks of submitting my application, I got no response from them.  
When I called the customer service department, the clerk said it takes 4 to 6 weeks of processing.  
A week later I called, they got my application, but my check was missing.


Surprisingly, I got a $400 bill in the mail.  
I got back on the phone and explained the situation.  
The clerk told me that it was an error in processing.  
She asked me where I sent it.  
I told her it was the Boston address, which they have included in the application.  
She replied by asking me to photocopy my receipt again and send it to a Sacramento address.


On the fourth week, I called my bank to see if the check had cleared.  
The check was not cashed.  
At this point, I threw up my arms, not knowing if the check was lost or E-trade was still processing my application.


By the fifth week, my grief had ended.  
They accepted me as a customer and I was able to purchase $1400 of stocks.


The opportunities to invest at the end of December turned out to be disappointing.  
I missed out on a 40% increase in returns from potential webvan shares.


I wonder how hard would it be to get my money after a year's time.  
I will follow-up with a secondary report on any difficulties.  
Their effort to recruit investors cost them their reputation.

		##  PoorOldEdgarDerby %% 03/08/2001 %% 5
I've had a PayPal account for about a year now and I've been extremely satisfied with it.
It is unbelievably convenient for things like auctions, for which I have used it many times as both the seller and the buyer.
It's also great for times when someone wants to send you money.
For instance I bought some shoes for my father that he wanted but that I could get for a considerable discount because of an employee friend of mine, so I bought them and dropped them in the mail and he PayPaled me the money.
From there it's just a click of the mouse to wire transfer it into my bank account and it's free.
I have only two problems with PayPal:
1.) currently you can't use if for things like your average everyday purchase such as if I go to Amazon or some other etailer.
I still need to use a credit card.
I would much prefer to have an online account and just pay for it through that account which contains a finite amount of money and I can check whenver I want, updates immediately, etc. rather than have to keep a watchful eye on my credit card to be sure I'm not getting overcharged (which has happened)
2.) I was somewhat miffed to have to upgrade to another level of PayPal account recently because they instituted a policy whereby if want to receive more than $100 worth of funds from a credit card to your free account you either need to refuse the payment or upgrade.
Upgrading was free but they then let you accept credit card payments above $100 but there is a 2.2% processing fee.
This doesn't really bother me because I can understand the costs involved shouldn't be swallowed by them I just think it was kind of cheesey the way they did it, ie. waiting until I had money pending and then springing this on me as opposed to just requesting that I upgrade.
Overall though PayPal is an excellent service and I would definitely recommend to anyone, in fact I do when someone involved in a auction doesn't use/accept it I will recommend they sign up.
First of all they'll give you both $5 for the sign up and it just makes the whole transaction process so much faster, and safer than just seding off a cashiers check.

I have used it more then 7 to 8 times a month.
It is a great way to pay when I purchase something on ebay and better yet, when someone buys from me.
If you want to buy from me, paypal is the best way to do it if you want your product NOW.
Send me a check: 3-5 days to reach me, 2-5 days to clear, 1-10 days shipping it to you.
I don't think that I have ever had more then a 1 day delay on funds tranferring from one person to the next.
Fast, easy, and cheap.

            I picked E*Trade for my broker because (1) they were a big brand name so I expected reliable service, (2) I was told that they had fast execution times, and (3) they gave individuals access to IPOs.


For reliable service, E*Trade is not the best choice. 
They are plagued by frequent outages and slowdowns. 
For one of the first online brokerages, there is no excuse for this. 
They've had several years to learn how to make their service better and upgrade capacity; instead of investing in proper systems, they have been throwing away money at cute commercials. 
They should also work with someone like Akamai to make sure that their content is always reachable.


For fast execution times, I have no complaints. 
After their system accepts an order (which it does not reliably do), I've never placed a stock order that hasn't executed within a minute.


For access to IPOs... 
I have never been allocated shares in any offering that I have been interested in. 
There are probably tens of thousands of E*Trade users fighting over the shares in each offering. 
E*Trade publishes no data on the number of customers who express interest in each IPO and the number who are actually allocated shares. 
If my experience is typical, then if there is a lot of demand for an IPO, the probability of being allocated shares in the offering is less than 5%. 
Although it is nice to fantasize about what I would have done if I had received my order for 200 shares of Foundry Networks, TheStreet.Com, or GlobeSpan, I don't believe that I ever had a realistic chance of receiving shares in any of these offerings through E*Trade.


This is not to say that there aren't nice things about E*Trade. 
They do provide good research, they do have a nice UI, and they do offer a large selection of financial products other than equities. 
They also have very helpful customer service, although it can often take over a day to get a question answered. 
If these things are worth an extra $5-15 a trade to you, then go for it. 
Otherwise, I'd probably pick Datek, DLJ, Lombard, or someone else.

		Hi!

I responded to an ad online as I'm interested in my Master's Degree. 
I got called back almost immediately.


It was apparent that the "Admissions Advisor" was really a salesman reading off of a script. 
I decided to check out CTU Online on the internet.


I read some poor reviews of CTU Online, and one that connected them with "American InterContinental University" which I confirmed (via multiple websites) is on probation. 
I read a very negative review of AIU, which led me to search further.


The parent company of CTU Online is Career EDU Corp, a for-profit company. 
I'm not so interested in getting a degree from a for-profit company, and when I found out that AIU was on probation, I was done.


This is from the parent website:
http://www.careered.com/


"Career Education is an industry leader whose gold-standard brands are recognized globally. 
Those brands include, among others, the Le Cordon Bleu Schools North America; the Harrington College of Design; the Brooks Institute of Photography; the Katharine Gibbs Schools; American InterContinental University; Colorado Technical University and Sanford-Brown Institutes and Colleges."


I would avoid any of the above institutions, based on what I found out.


Note: I haven't attended CTU Online, which is why I gave them a "2" rating vs. a "1". 
My rating is based on my contact with their employees and my research online. 
There are reviews from students of CTU Online that like their experience.


Here is the review of AIU:

PS-If you're a student at any of the schools above, I'm not cutting you down, and I hope it goes well for you.

## Topic: new fees turn me off
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I was a huge fan of e-trade, mainly because I was able to keep my savings account somewhat liquid in a California Exempt tax money market.  
This money market would earn twice the interest of a standard savings account, and the interest was not taxable.  
What a great deal.  
It was, until recently.


E-Trade just imposed a new fee for "non-active" traders.  
This account management fee is a $15 every quarter (3 months) starting in March.  
To avoid this fee, you must complete two trades within six months.  
Since two trades cost $40, you are basically going to be charged either $30 or $40 every six months.  


The other way to avoid this fee is have a total of at least $5,000 in liquid assets in your account.


I am not an active trader, nor am I well off enough to have that much in my savings account.  
I have made only a a dozen or so trades in the three years I have had this account.  
I went with E-Trade with those factors in mind.  
With this new account management fee, I am quickly looking around for other spots to keep my money.


The website is really easy to navigate.  
They have easy to use tabs to get you to the exact spot you need to go.  
If you need to trade, click the "trade" tab, if you want to find out about a stock, hit "quotes and research".  
Pretty easy going.  
Load times differ depending on the time of day, the fastest times coming of course later at night after trading hours.  
My 56K modem didn't have much of a problem loading the pages though.


E-Trade seems to be a good system for somewhat active traders.  
The commission fee is high at $20 per trade, but you get unlimited free realtime quotes, and lots of research options.  
Trades are executed quickly, and I have always had exactly the right amount of shares traded at the exact price I wanted.


Customer service is hit or miss.  
I have had times when I waited for about 5 minutes, and other times where I had to hang up because I lost my patience.

## Topic: An Egroup for everyone!.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Last week I received an invitation to join (hwz1) egroup, a reading group for epinions designed by the owner to increase r/r for the members of the group.  
I had never heard of Egroups before (Perhaps I am behind the times, huh?)
and decided that it was something I would check out.  
Here's what I found...

**************************************************************************

The Site

I went to www.egroups.com and saw that I needed to register for the site (which is free) and then I could explore and become a member of any group that was listed.  
Boy, were there a lot of them!  
Of course, I first decided to search "Epinions" in the search box, and came up with quite a lot of groups dedicated to the site.  
I decided which ones most interested me and joined, which was all easily done by fast navigation.  
After I chose the Epinions groups to join, I decided to see what else the site offered. 
So, of course, me being the *blushin bride* I decided to check out weddings (We brides to be just can't get enough of the wedding stuff! 
:-) ) So, I searched weddings and found several groups for it, but decided on one with a large amount of subscribers, Ultimate Weddings.  
This is the one that I decided to join.  
I then went and searched "deer hunting" for my honey and found an egroup called Buckmasters with about 80 members, and then set his account up and got him in on the action. 
This, with gun season opening next week made him a very happy man!  
Those hunters are kinda like the brides, they can't get enough of the deer talk!


When you decide which egroup you want to join, however you decide, whether it be to search, or to look under categories, you will be given several options.  


Your first option is to receive all emails from the group.  
What this means is that, for example, if janedoe1@aol.com sends a message to hwz1@egroups.com, everyone that is a member of that group will recieve an email from janedoe1@aol.com and will display [hwz1] proceeding the title in the subject line of the email, so that you will know it came from your group.  


Your second option is to recieve a daily digest of emails that the group sent out.  
With this option, you will recieve a digest of every 25 or so emails that were sent by the group, all added into one email. 
And again, beside the Digest number XXX in the subject line, the name of your egroup will be displayed.


Your third option will be to recieve no emails, but to check the posts on the website. 
This is not something I would recommend if you want the egroup to work for you, and you really want to become active in your group. 
It is much easier to have it sent to your inbox.

 
The Pros 

The positive side of the egroups is that you will meet lots of new people, and if you join an Epinions egroup, you will certainly see a change in your number of hits.  
If you join another type of Egroup, like me with weddings, you will find lots of people who are interested in the same things as you and who can offer some great advice!

 
The Cons 

Alright, word of advice.  
When you choose your groups, the screen will display how many members are in that group.  
If there are 200 members in every group that you join and you join 4 groups, it is very possible that you are going to get about 800 emails per day.  
WHAT?!!  
Yep, I am dead serious, you will get a MASSIVE quantity of emails. 
I made this mistake.  
I joined three large Epinions groups, one small epinions group, and the large wedding group. 
By the end of the day, I had to unsubscribe to two of the Epinions groups and digest one of the large ones, and only recieve individual emails from the smaller one, and my wedding group.  
Now, I don't know about you, but finding the time to r/r about 900 Epinions per day and still proceeding with normal daily life and plan my wedding is virtually IMPOSSIBLE. 


The Outcome 
 So, after I learned my lesson, things are going much easier for me!  
I have the time to r/r most of the epinions I get the day that I recieve them, and if not, I can catch up the next day.  
With my wedding group, it is so much fun, exchanging wedding websites with the girls, and learning about their weddings. 
I highly recommend egroups to all of you, but remember the tips about digesting and/or the number of groups you subscribe to!


And one last thing...if you join an Epinions one, you better read just as much as you post!!!!  
It is a give and take situation, not a take-take!


Thanks for r/r and Happy Epinionating!

## Topic: Awkward trading user interface
## Score: 2.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            I became so unhappy with E-Trade that I have decided to move my
account to a better service.  
Basically, their service is quite slow
and they do not use real-time quotes by default.  
In addition, you
must open a second browser windows to view quotes and positions 
prior to calculating the number of shares to buy.


I'm still researching which broker to move to.  
(Fidelity.com has 
a *much* better user interface for trading, with quick and easy 
access to real-time quotes, current positions and balances.  
But 
it has other problems, like it does not update the value of funds 
available to invest as you make trades, does not offer year-end 
capital gain summary for stocks, and keeps history only 90 days back.)


This is an actual email I sent to E-Trade on Nov 30, 1999
with their replies.

...........................

E-Trade,

I find your trading service so unacceptable that I will
move my funds elsewhere.


I purchased 1924 shares of INOW close to the opening bell
on Tuesday, Nov 30, 1999
.


- Placing an order uses 20-min delayed quotes by default
  This forces me to open a separate window for real-time
  quotes.  
Why not use real-time quotes for all orders?

- After placing an order, I could not find the status of
  my order for 5 minutes.  
It took that long for an alert
  to show up.  
Then I found out the price had gone up so
  far as to exceed my available funds, so I had to re-order
  at 100 fewer shares.  
Meanwhile the price went up $1.
  
A much quicker status is needed.  
I figure I lost $1900.
  
Now much consolation in paying a $19.95 fee
.

- The notice telling me the order was "Not OK" did not
  include the order number, only the time. 
So when I 
  saw it later (I placed 3 orders of 2000, 1900 and 24), 
  I didn't know if this was my last order
  or a previous one (it was a previous one)
.

- Clicking "View Open Orders" does nothing but tell me
  to try later to phone your brokers.  
This went on for
  a half hour.  
I couldn't phone since I'm on a 56K modem.
  
Besides the waits are notoriously long
.

- The Alert box is confusing.  
"Next" gets the previous
  alert in time, and "Previous" gets the next alert in time.
  
(I now know "Next" means next alert in list
.
)
- It's apparently not possible to go from a chart view
  of 1 day "Detailed" to 1 day "Real-time quote", because
  clicking on "Go" takes you to the 3 month view.  
The 
  Go button ignores the time interval radio button
.
 
- When the trades were all complete, just as I was 
  finishing this email, I tried to get a real-time quote
  on INOW and the page gave me this instead:
  (BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" TOPMARGIN=0 
  LEFTMARGIN=0   MARGINHEIGHT=0 MARGINWIDTH=0 

Fidelity, a company that doesn't specialize in stocks,
does a much better job, letting you see the real-time 
quote in another HTML frame of the same window, and
keeps you in constant status of your job.


I've tolerated your poor trading service for over a year,
hoping it would eventually clear up, but can no longer do so.

It's not only poorly designed, but also poorly implemented.

----- Reply from E-Trade (from two emails) -----------------

Dear Mr. 
Kramer:

Thank you for choosing E*TRADE.


I apologize for the inconveniences that you have encountered and I understand your frustration. 
I have provided you with some information 
in regards to real time quotes.  
I hope that this information is useful to you and makes your trading experience easier and faster.


If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us. 

We would be more than happy to assist you and answer any questions 
you may have.


If you want to be sure you get real-time quotes all of the time ?

regardless of your trading pattern ? 
you can subscribe to our real-time
quote service by paying a low monthly fee (for real-time quote pricing
information, see the Learning Center topic "Delayed or real-time
quotes)." 
To subscribe, download the Real-Time Quotes agreement
(in PDF format) or fill out the Real-Time Quotes form and we'll send it
to you (by mail). 


If you want all of your quotes to be real time, you can mail in an agreement and pay a fee of $14.95 [per month] as a non-professional subscriber or $49.95 if you are a professional or have a corporate account.  
Each  trade that executes in your account  earns a $3.24 
credit that is applied first toward connect-time fees, then toward 
real time quotes.  

... 
Real time quotes do not apply to any of the charts  or graphs on our site.

...


Sincerely,
Brenda Simpson
 
E*TRADE Customer Service

		Its not perfect, but it works for individuals who are motivated, hardworking and yet are busy with their careers. 
The medium of instruction deserves some improvement, but otherwise, I think it has all the pros and cons of any regular F2F university. 
It has both excellent and mediocre professors. 
It has some who are very involved in classes while there are other professors who should be barred from entering any school, not just online. 
I think, as a student completing my masters in Information Technology, it is not a bad school at all. 
Can't vouch for the other streams though.

## Topic: E-Trade holds up reasonably well under pressure
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            With all of the volatility in the stock market in the past few weeks, I've been putting several brokerages to the test. 
E-Trade has been one of the two online brokerages I have used, and I've generally been happy with the service.


I've been very active in keeping tabs on, and executing some trades, on the days the markets have been quite up and down. 
My goal is to buy on the dip, and sell after several days of run-up. 
So I've been pounding away on the real-time quotes available, and trading at several select times. 
Please note that I do this on a cable modem that is quite good about keeping timely internet response; service through your ISP may vary.


In general, I've been very happy with the E-Trade response time on these features. 
I've had no issues with the site actually being down. 
I've gotten a real-time quote on demand about 90 - 95% of the time, each within a minute or two of the current time (which I understand is about all I can expect from an online brokerage). 
Every now and then there seems to be a cookie issue that asks me to log in again, but it doesn't happen too often and I can fix it real quick. 
I've also been able to put in trades quite quick, and can get confirmation within about a minute after putting in the trade. 


Customer service has been pretty decent, if a bit slow. 
I had a question about a tender offer to buyback stock I owned, and one or two conditions E-Trade has regarding these offers were not documented. 
My e-mail went unanswered for a day, then was automatically escalated to a level where I got a quick response. 
Fortunately, I did not need the answer immediately. 
Calling customer service has variable speed, with good speed regarding account change issues (like adding an IRA account, or enabling other features), but slower response on other issues, like usage questions. 
This speed differential is due to different queues for different issues.


I am not fond of E-Trade's requirement that cash has to be in account in order to trade stocks. 
I know that, for the most part, I should be able to have cash in the account for trading I plan to do, but sometimes I see opportunities that I can move quickly and take advantage of. 
Outside of having an E-Trade bank account, the quickest transfer time seems to be about 3 days, far too long for quickly moving markets. 
I keep a Waterhouse account where I can do this sort of trading, and use this service for more of my pre-planned trading.


Overall, I give E-Trade 4 stars, largely due to web site response and reliability. 
Site response is superior to Waterhouse, and I don't see it being beat by other online services. 
Customer service and deposit requirement issues weigh down the rating, but these issues can be managed more easily than a slow / unreliable web site.

## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            Although E*Trade may be cheaper than seeking the services of a professional broker, I am at times led to question whether the discount is really worth the hassle.


When I first decided to open an E*Trade account, I remember reading on their site that it would be opened approximately 3 to 5 business days after my check and papers are received. 
It took over two weeks. 
Now I know that the mail service would only take a few days and 3 to 5 business days added on to that does not add up to two weeks. 
I have no idea what took so long.


After my account was finally opened, I decided to purchase some mutual funds. 
One fund, among others, that I was particularly interested in was the Fidelity Select Biotechnology fund. 
I was appalled to find that E*Trade did not offer it. 
Now I would understand if this was some random fund that no one was interested in. 
However, it's a very prominent fund that I am sure would generate much interest. 
E*Trade should really think about expanding their variety when it comes to mutual funds.


To continue, their alerts about account activity take a very long time to arrive. 
When their users spend thousands of dollars on orders, they should at least attempt to be prompt and efficient with the orders. 
When I placed orders for 3 mutual funds, I did not receive notification that they were bought until 2 days later. 
During those 2 days, I called customer service to try to figure out what the problem with the orders were. 
After about half an hour of busy signals, I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative who was of no help at all. 
I must admit that customer service was very polite, but not knowing how the system works, they were able to tell me nothing. 
After being transferred to a few different departments and listenning to recordings of elevator music while waiting, I finally was able to speak to a broker who told me there really shouldn't be a problem and I should just wait. 


At this point, I am thinking maybe it would have been a better idea to just use another company or even a professional broker. 
Maybe I would then have better luck with knowing where my money goes.

		I attended the UoP for a year and maintained straight A's in my courses. 
I enjoyed the courses very much and learned a lot. 
The time commitment far exceeds the average listed, this is definitely not a free ride to a piece of paper.My frustration is not with the content of the program but with the administration of the "company". 
I had a new financial and academic councilor every month. 
Each of them appeared to be young adults trying to fund their own education with little experience in their positions. 
My financial aid was a mess! 
I obtained my student loans and was still expected to pay out of pocket every other class. 
Every time there was a different story as to why this was required.I 
weathered through these frustrations to continue my program. 
The final straw was when my region (half the state) experienced a power outage of up to 2 weeks. 
I had just started a new course and call the UoP right away to be removed to start a new class as I had no way of attending class.I was put off until it was "too late" to withdraw, given an incomplete grade and then asked to pay for a course I had not taken. 
Months of frustrating phone conversations later I had the charge removed.Problem 
solved right? 
WRONG, they sent my student loan payment of $3700.oo 
back to my loan agency and have now sent me to collections for a balance owing of over 990.00 dollars.My 
student loan totals 3900.00, 
I paid for at least one class out of pocket and now owe 900.00 and I had the loan money to pay for it all. 
I am truly confused by this process and have had no luck with the obstinate staff.STAY 
AWAY!! Go to your local community college and try their correspondence courses if you need to take your classes from home. 
You will be served properly, charge appropriately and get the education you need. 
Don't pay through the nose for the promise of a faster degree.In 
reading these reviews: For those of you that have had a great experience more power to you, but don’t judge others poorly just because their opinion differs from yours. 
Perhaps you failed to learn the team lessons that the UoP promotes so intensively.

Compared with others with whom I am acquainted who earned their doctoral degrees from brick-and-mortars, the education I received was vastly superior. 
I highly recommend Capella to bright, motivated, self-starters who enjoy learning, researching and writing.

            I have been a member of e-groups for a long time and although I have been a member of other such sites I much prefer this one. 
It runs fairly smooth most of the time with little down time.


You just go to www.egroups.com and fill in a few facts about yourself and you are a member. 
There are all kinds of lists or groups you can get on after that. 
They cover just about any interest you have.


It works by e-mail and I call it an e-mail chat. 
You can go whenever you want and e-mail back and forth with a group of people that share your same interests. 
You get to make new friends and share ideas and it is not as time consuming as a regular chat room and you can read the messages at your leisure and answer when you have time yet still stay in touch.


I have a group of my own going for writers and really enjoy it. 
We share tips and offer feedback on what others write. 
I prefer smaller groups as there isn't as much e-mail. 
However there are 3 e-mail settings to pick from.


One is individual where you get each e-mail seperately as it comes in. 
Then there is a digest form where you get one or two e-mails a day with all the letters in them.

Last there is web only where you get no e-mail at all but you read it off the main page of the group and you can still post an answer to the group.


Find something you are interested in and try one. 
It can be a lot of fun.

		Words that best describe this school and WIU: ATROSCIOUS, SHOCKING, UPSETTING, UNSPEAKABLE, DISPICABLE, LIARS. 
This school is terrible when it comes to honesty and intergrity. 
The counselors do not communicate with you, and are appalling. 
They lie and note that they have communicated with you and never contacted you. 
The instructors are very inconsistant, but it doesn't surprise me as the entire staff seems to be. 
I am so dissapointed in this school, all I ever heard about was university of phoenix. 
I think at some point they were a number one online school, but somewhere they have lost what may have qualified them to be a number 1 school. 
I also was duped with my financial aid &amp; loans. 
They don't care about anything but money. 
The classes I had were worthless. 
I had better classes in the community college I attended, now I wish I had stayed. 
The desire to have convience for me, is above all.

		My husband is a graduate of CTU with a Master's in Software Engineering. 
He is also now a virtual adjunct professor for the school. 
He is a very dedicated instructor and does his best to make sure his students understand the material. 
He is also employed at a large company as the Enterprise IT Manager, meaning he is in charge of the entire company's IT needs. 
This is a very challenging, demanding, and well paying position that he would not have gotten without his degree from CTU. 
He worked hard to earn his degree while working full-time and helping me raise our 2 children. 
He earned his Bachelor's degree from a very reputable liberal arts school with many accredidations and felt that CTU was equaly challenging with equal possetive and negative issues on the business side.


I recently transferred my credits to CTU, no problem, to complete my degree. 
I feel I have been treated very well and my classes are in deed challenging. 
This is no diploma mill. 
This is a regionally accredited school with qualified instructors. 
In fact, because my husband is a professor, I was given nearly a full scholarship from CTU. 
I will earn my degree and only end up paying a little over a thousand dollars. 
That is not a typical gift from a school that only cares about the money.


I think all schools have their pro's and con's and all students have possetive and negative experiences with the school they attend. 
I have had some challenging classes and some easy classes at every school I have attended, CTU is my 4th. 
CTU has their share of possetives and negatives for sure, but I think it is unfair for people who clearly haven't done their research, to critisize an entire school based on a couple experiences with a few staff members.


Online education is in high demand and all schools are cashing in on it. 
Stanford, Columbia, Cornell, Berkley; these are only a few of the Ivy League schools now offering online programs. 
There are many reputable accredited schools offering this option. 
US News lists hundreds of big name schools accredited by the same organization as CTU, using the same virtual course software, charging the same or higher fees, with some lousey professors and some great ones, and that also have their share of pro's and con's wether it be in the education or business arena's.

## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            eGroups history.

eGroups was formerly known as "onelist" ... 
This is when I first opened my first group. 
They were much smaller, but large enough that I didn't think they would notice if I ran a questionable-material group. 
My first list started out with x-rated cartoons. 
You know the kind. 
Office humor, toilet humor, and eventually some anime. 
When onelist announced it's merge with Egroups, I started wondering if they were going to get morals as well, and toss out my list.


So did my list move?

Nope! 
The group was allowed to stay, in fact, I've started a few more lists. 
Egroups does have a page that makes you consent to viewing the adult pictures before you can view it the questionable material. 
It's a good way for adults to get pictures that they want if they don't have a credit card. 
(or if they don't want to put their credit card online.

Draw-backs?

Of course there are draw backs. 
For one, the pictures come in your email, usually one by one. 
So, if someone on the list decides to send in 30 pictures one day, that's how many you get. 
(unless the owner of the list chooses to spend time to approve each email first.) 
Also, if someone puts dozens of pictures into one email, it may block up your email server with your internet providor. 
However, Egroups isn't just pictures. 
They also have discussions, and up-dates.


On the good hand!

On the good hand, as I mentioned above, you do not need a credit card to access their service. 
They are not a porn service, don't get me wrong. 
They run many mailing lists. 
There are lists for every dog-lover, or stressed out manager, or converstations for military house-wives. 
They also subscribe to many magazines, like Cosmo, and Prevention, so you can get only the good headlines if you want. 
Your email address has to confirm and approve to every list, so you won't be added to mailing lists that you don't want to be on. 
Egroups has never added me to a list I didn't want to be on, or sent me any spam. 
(unsolicited e-mail)

The Long Run.

I've been with Egroups (onelist) for almost 2 years. 
They have always been a reliable service. 
They try to prevent spam by only allowing a maximum amount of emails sent per user per day. 
They are helpful to web-page developers who want to keep certain people up to date with their changes. 
I would recommend Egroups to family members too. 
You could use it as a global update. 
There are calenders in their web page, where you could put everyone's birthdays and emails would be sent out to remind everyone subscribed to the list. 
You can upload family photos, and have everyone notified when there are new pictures to view. 
When you send a message to the list, everyone on the list would get that email, instantly.


Egroups VS other mailing services.

To be honest, Egroups (onelist) was my first mailing list choice, and I haven't even bothered to look into other services. 
This one has everything I need to stay in touch with everyone that I want to.

had joined an engagement list and now own 3 list and moderate
others. eGroups is definitely top quality when it comes
to running and maintaining email lists. 
I have tried others 
and always return to eGroups. 
The recent merger between 
eGroups and Onelist has made the service even better, in
my opinion. 
They also just made a deal with Yahoo to merge
some of their services (as of 9/00).


The site is easy to use and pretty self explanatory to new 
comers or current users. 
When I introduce friends to eGroups, 
they have no problem understanding how to use the site and 
how to sign up for lists. 
On your home page you can easily 
subscribe, unsubscribe, change mail delivery to digest, go 
no mail, remove html from messages, hide your personal 
information, create a group, search for a group, etc. 
Anyone 
can create a list to match their interests. 
I created one 
recently for women in my neighborhood. 
It's a great way to 
communicate with people who you would otherwise rarely see. 


The eGroups service is top notch and I have never had problems 
when managing my lists or getting my questions answered by
the well trained staff. 
If there is a glitch with one of my
lists, it is fixed quickly and efficiently by the quality staff.

eGroups has something for everyone. 
The offer everything from 
craft groups to marriage support lists to military spouses. 
I
have joined groups that pertain to my religion, hobbies, and 
education.


I have made many lifelong friends through eGroups and it 
has all been free. 
In August 2000, I met a group of friends 
on the East coast that I met through eGroups. 
It was wonderful
to finally put faces with names and on-line personalities. 

eGroups also takes SPAM (junk e-mail) and flaming very
seriously and moderates the lists in a friendly yet stern way.


I owe so much to eGroups and have enjoyed every moment I 
have used their services. 
I can't imagine my life without my 
lists or the friends I have made through them. 
I intend to use 
them for many years to come.

		I have just finished an Associates in Accounting degree and am currently in my first class in the Bachelor's in Information Technology degree track. 
I have to agree with GoCryToYOurMommyDontCryHere. 
The people who are whining about UoP being the worst school ever are the ones who didn't finish, which is obvious. 
The ones who talk about get swindled or hoodwinked with FAFSA and scholarship loans are probably the ones with sub-prime mortgages that have begun ballooning and they're probably whining about how they were hoodwinked into those as well. 
It's always somebody else's fault and they're not afraid to shout it out to the world. 
The ones who complain about UoP costing so much obviously never went to college anywhere before this. 
Here's a clue folks, it's not any cheaper at a university. 
Do you think UoP is in it for the joy? 
It's a for-profit organization...

If you are serious about going to school and getting an education, but don't want to add the extra commitment of being somewhere at a given time to attend classes, UoP fits the bill. 
I can come home and work in the evenings and weekends and not have to worry about being somewhere to attend class for three hours at a crack.


The classes offer real education and learning, but to get the most out of them you have to do the work. 
In the 20+ classes I've taken so far, no matter how elementary I thought they were at the beginning, I always came away having learned something new. 
Instructors vary in quality, but most are hard-working and want to help you succeed. 
The ones that aren't get weeded out fairly quickly.


UoP allows anyone who wants to pay them to attend, so a diverse group of people will enroll. 
Some will be shocked by the work they will have to do in class and soon you'll be hearing from them in this forum. 
Only two or three per class will have the organization and determination to do well. 
Most every person who does enroll will have sub-standard writing abilities, some because they never learned, and some because they got lazy over the years. 
The ones who stay will sharpen those skills and become more polished in their thinking and their writing.


Bottom line: It's not cheap, but then you're paying for an extensive infrastructure built to deliver education to you wherever you go. 
Don't expect to have your hand held just because you're paying money for the class. 
The purpose of school is to learn, and that has to come from within.

		I have been a student for almost a year at UOP and I have had no problems with it. 
It did concern me reading all the bad reviews, but I never experienced anything that those reviews were stating. 
The classes can get challenging at times, but I've always been able to get a hold of the instructor either online or by phone. 
They've been a great help.

## Topic: E*Trade Tried and True
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I've had my E*Trade account for over 4 years and the reason is because of inertia.
(There was not much choice in online brokers back then) Now I am too lazy to switch to a new broker - although I almost did when then site went down and I was unable to execute a trade for quite a while (the Telemaster phone system was constantly busy of course). 
They definitely learned their lesson from this - their stock price took a HUGE hit during that time.


The new site is nice and works quite well (looks pretty). 
But It is a bit heavy (I have a broadband, but on 56K I imagine it is slow ?) 
and there are constant glitches - A few times a month some of the features stop working (portfolio, sometimes during trading hours) this is annoying, but you are still able to execute trades. 
I have used various account features such as added Options Trading to my account (an easy and painless procedure) or sent out wire transfers. 
All have gone very smoothly.


There is more to an online broker than just trading features (unless you are daytrading - can you say Datek (an ISLD broker, big plus), the online support of the website makes calling customer service a very rare task indeed. 
In the past I did have to call them and have experienced inordinate wait times. 
This all *seems* to be resolved now (although I have heard otherwise) and the one time I have recently called I was only on hold for a few minutes. 
In the few times I have sent questions to Customer Service they have replied promptly and knew what they were talking about.


I attempted to subscribe to receive allocation in an IPO but they declined me, saying that I was not qualified enough to do so, even though I am able to do so with another brokerage account - Doesn't matter E*Trade doesn't seem to be very focused on IPO's anyway.


They are still innovative for a large company - For instance, it is the only place (unless you are a Goldman Sachs client) where you can buy low-expense mutual funds that track various indexes such as the GS Technology Index or E-Commerce Index.


There is nothing particularly amazing about E*Trade but the security that goes along with a trusted brand name might be worth it for some.

		I am working with an advisor for CTU and she is really friendly and non pushy. 
I wanted to start classes May 23 but she wanted me to wait until the start date in July so my paperwork work for finacial aid does not have to be rushed and I can see where I stand with aid. 
I also had problems accessing one of the webpages Friday night after 10:00pm an she connected me to technical support to esolve the issue. 
The technician even helped me walk thru the application to make sure I did not have any more technical issues. 
I just sent them transcipt request forms. 
I will wait and see what classes they accept and if not enough i will not sign up for classes but so far I have had a very positive experience. 
I can call and talk to someone 24 hours a day and reach techincal support regarding ANY online issue 24 hours a day. 
There online program has alot of featurs as well. 
I find it hard to believe all the negative issues with the advisors. 
I could call her now and talk to her if i like and she answers all my email within 5 minutes when she works from 5pm to 5am central time.

		I just finished my AA in Business/General Studies through UOP (Axia). 
I have to admit, I have learned twice as much in this school, with this set up and schedule, than in any other college. 
I really think that the topic of UOP is 50-50; it goes both ways and there will never be a wrong or a right answer. 
It is an opinion and I find it hard to believe that people who attended one class can bad mouth the school (Some don't even make it through one class, they drop out 2 weeks into it). 
A bad situation can happen to anyone, and perhaps this resulted in a cost of a lot of money for that person, but I think that, that goes for everything. 
If one were to have a bad experience, especially for the first time trying something new, it would appear as something that doesn't work for you. 
To go and bad mouth the school based upon this situation is just wrong. 
I loved all my experiences with this school and I am proud to say that I will be transferring over to the UOP bachelors in Business Management.


P.S 
I have met many students who have attended UOP, who have gotten their master's, and gotten employed right away. 
I am proud to tell you most of them drive expensive cars, what does that say? 
I have to tell you, if you are debating the school because of what someone else says, you should just give up all together (would you jump off the cliff with them too?) It is expensive, but they work with you and they have always been great (I got my financial aid with no problems at all). 
I never would have never been able to finish school had it not been for this school. 
I thank God for the creation of something so great for my education. 
It really is a Blessing!!

            I don't recall exactly how I found this site, but I love it.  
There are many, many lists to choose from and if you can't find what you are looking for, you can start your own list.  
It may take a while to get a subscriber, but you're helping everyone out.  
I've actually started two of my own; one is for residents of Biscayne Park, FL, and the other is for sellers on half.com.


Once you sign up, all you have to do is find the list (or lists) you want, click on subscribe, and choose your settings.  
You have a choice of individual messages, a digest version, or simply using the web site to read and post messages.


Many of the lists are low-volume, so I'd like to see more people sign up for the service.  
Maybe we can increase the number of subscriptions.  
There are also several redundant lists.  
(I'd like to see a lot of those lists combined, if possible.)

		UOP financial aid department lacks professional workers which are rude and condesending. 
After about 9 months of trying to apply for financial aid, my funds were not certified due to the financial aid department not doing what they were suppose to do. 
Not to mention, I also was approved for the full Pell Grant, but due to the school not getting my funds certified...at all, I recieved nothing from my pell grant. 
I have called countless times to managers and even the director of financial aid and recieved no phone calls back. 
I am still trying to fight this issue, but at the same time am stuck with a $3500 dollar bill, in which if I don't make a payment soon, they threaten to put on my credit report. 
If anyone out there is thinking about trying UOP Online ... DON'T! 
It's a waste of money and you'll get screwed. 
I never thought a university such as UOP could be so dishonest and untrustworthy as they are. 
I will never recommend UOP to anyone. 
This is by far one of the worst universities out there.

		I would not recommend this school to anyone. 
After they got me enrolled I had difficulty getting responses from staff. 
Prior to my enrollment, they were super quick at responding. 
The teacher was useless. 
Classes are 5 weeks long, and she had not given out grades or feedback until the 4th week started, even though she was supposed to do it weekly. 
She ignored questions in the classroom newsgroup, and when pushed about getting feedback she got nasty and started posting about how we should respect those in authority. 
Give me a break. 
For the price, I expected top quality. 
What I got was total unprofessionalism. 
The learning teams are a pain too, so beware of those. 
Then they only allowed me credit for about half of my prior work, which tacks on a year and several thousand dollars. 
Forget it.

## Topic: eCircles: Structured, Yet Versatile
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
I recently stumbled onto eCircles.com while looking for an easy and inexpensive (preferably free) way to add interactive features to my Web site, Scraps and Scribbles. 
I just bought a new Compaq Presario, which came loaded with a predefined list of Favorites in Internet Explorer. 
I think I hit on eCircles.com by accident, but it seemed to offer the features I'd hoped to add to my site. 
Sign up was quick and easy. 
Within minutes, I was set up and ready to create my eCircles!


eCircles can be public, by request, or private. 
I set up a "by request" site for Scraps and Scribbles, and added a link to it from my site. 
Standard modules include a Summary page, People (member list and profiles), Announcements, Discussions (a combination bulletin board and mailing list), Photo Albums, Event Planner, Calendar, and Lists. 


Then I set up a private site for members of my family. 
While customizing the eCircles, I learned that I could add not only a Text Chat area, but Voice Chat using FireTalk. 
Within minutes my parents and I were talking--long distance--for free! 
They asked me for a list of Christmas gift suggestions for my husband, son, daughter, and me. 
That's when I added a Wish List--an easy way to provide family and friends with a wish list that even makes it easy to link to online stores.


From the Photo Albums page, you can quickly and inexpensively turn favorite photos into prints or unique gifts--from mugs and mouse pads to calendars, keepsake books, and clocks. 
You can send free "Virtual Gifts" to other members of your eCircles. 
Part of the fun is exploring and using all the features of eCircles!


If you have a Web page already, eCircles can be a fun addition to it. 
If you don't already have a Web page, eCircles can serve as one. 
You can't customize the layout, except in terms of the modules you choose to include or leave out. 
But you don't have to know HTML, either, and you can manage every aspect of your own eCircles. 
It's a great way to keep in touch and build your own online community.


Selected in June 1999 by PC World as the "Best Online Community Site," eCircles has quickly become one of my favorite sites and an indispensable tool for personal Web site development.

		Graduate Student: I'm enrolled in one of DeVry's graduate level programs. 
I thought it would be easy, but have found just the opposite. 
In reviewing information from other graduate programs [U-of-H and Texas A-M], DeVry appears to be requiring you to delivery similar work to the traditional classroom study at these campuses. 
My suggestion to anyone evaluating DeVry programs, is to checkout a few other universities before deciding. 
You might be surprised to find out that DeVry is not a push over. 
Good luck in any decision you make.

		I have to say the employees that supposively work for CTU that are rating the school as bad are full of it! 
I finished my first bachelors degree at the University of Colorado in Denver and personally found it time consuming and basically had to memorize, not apply any real knowledge. 
I think I have used maybe one or two things from that degree. 
I went back to get a second bachelors degree using CTU Online. 
I have learned so much, and I apply it to my every day job with the US Government.. which by the way has actually recommended CTU as a school... 
I find the courses real life based information applicable to my job and recently just completed a course in which I applied so much of the material to a Managing for Performance course for management at work.
I think every businesses main goal is to make money. 
I applied to UMass Online based off of their Lowell Campus and I also applied to a certificate program at George Mason online. 
I would say the recruiters/finance and advising groups were all as pushy as the other and "brick and mortar" schools can't even compare to the curriculum that I received and will continue to receive at CTU Online! 
Keep up the great work and I hope that more schools start to release the benefits of this type of learning.

## Topic: Review of Etrade
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            I have been using Etrade since 1997 and I am very satisfied with their overall service.


Content:
You get to trade stocks, bonds, options and mutual funds.  
There is a tremendous amount of information.  
You also get Etrade specific index funds that come with no fee and no load.  
The community and chat parts of this site are not that useful.  
Not too many people use these features

Pricing:
Etrade is now one of the more expensive places to trade.  
Commissions are 14.95-19.95 for regular accounts.  
They do have an upgrde called Power etrade that gives level II quotes and trades as low as 4.95 if yo uahve more than 30 trades a quarter.  
personally i trade a lot but haven't found it necessary to use this since I am not a daytrader. 
I think for the amount of sevices that you get plus the reliability it is a good price.


navigation:
When I first joined (even before this new site), I noticed that navigation was extremely easiy.  
Finding different parts of the site was just as easy.

The new site is even better.  
This site has a vast amount of information and services and they are very easily accessible.


Reliability and speed:
Execution times are among the best in the business.  
However their reliability is average( border  line below average).  
Almost every day i get messages that I can not access vertain parts.  
Charts are slow to load and until recently they had no TA charts.


Other features:
One thing that I like a lot is that Etrade doesn't get on my back regarding margin requirments.  
Other sites might be a little quicker to ask you to liquidate or put mor money in but Etrade has been very good with that.  
In fact that is one reason i won't switch to any other broker.  
Plus, their execution is extremely fast and reliable.  
I place a lot of limit orders and I have heard that other brokers are not as good with executing "close calls".


After-hours trading is tricky.  
since there is no market makers after the closing the volume shrinks up and the only way to make a trade is by matching the buyers and sellers electronically.  
because of this they have made it a rule to not have any odd lots that means you can only trade 100 or 200 shares at a time.  
Furthermore, just because small time investors are willing to pay a certain amount on a stock it does not meand teh market makers will agree with that price in the morning.  
I have never placed an after hour order and I don't recommend it since there is not real stock quote and no liquidity.


Etrade has successfully integrated other companies products and services into their sites.  
You can get discounts on a lot of things for becoming an Etrade customer including frequent flyer miles and PCs. 


They have an amazing phone system too for when the site is down.  
i like the cool voice recognition aspects that allows yyou to trade hands free.  
i have used this feature when I was on the road and had no access to a PC.

They are also very good with helping you with taxes (schedule D) and cash transfers into the account. 


Overall rating = A:
I recommend this site specially to beginners.  
It is very secure, highly informative and easy to navigate.  
I found that other sites are not as easy and beginners have had trouble getting around and placing trades.

Advanced traders might like the power Etrade features and portfolio management and option trading.  
Personnaly, I do my technical analysis and chart viewing at other sites (clearstation, askresearch). 
On the bad side, Etrade does have technical problems often and it is slow to load. 
In that case their phone ordering system is a good alternative.


Don't be fooled by other financial sites offering lower commissions.  
You get what you pay for.  
And of the love of god, do some research before buying a stock!!

## Topic: Etrade is Doing it Right!

## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            In the dog days of Dow Jones' downs and Nasdaq falls, it seems there's nowhere to put your money.  
What little money I have, I want it safe and diversified. 
Enter Etrade.


I've been with every broker on the map:  Schwab, Ameritrade, Datek, and finally lastly with Etrade.  
In searching for a financial service, I wanted one with a variety of services and Etrade has it all:  insurance, home mortgage, banking, credit cards, and brokerage.  
Their stock trades are a flat 19.95 which is competitive to Schwab at 29.95, but not with Ameritrade and Datek whose trades average $8-10.


But if you want all your financial accounts under one roof, I can't think of a better place to go besides your local bank.  
Etrade has morphed into a competitive financial service.  
Think Fidelity.  
Think Bank One.  
Think Citigroup.  
Only cheaper and less restrictive.


They link all accounts to a home page so when you access the online site you see all accounts on one screen.  
Example:  I have a bank savings account and a broker account.  
When I go to the home page, all the accounts are listed showing a total value.


How neat!  
I do very little trading with Etrade because I am a buy-hold person.  
I have a bond fund, a closed end fund, and a stock fund.  
These funds earn dividends, so I sit back and let them reinvest.


The Etrade web site is so friendly and easy to understand there's no way to get confused while navigating the site.  
The requirements to open accounts are very minimal:  $1000 for the bank, -0- for the broker account.  
Schwab requires a minimum of $5000 for broker account.


Another neat service Etrade has is ATM machines around the country.  
In my city, their ATMs are located in Target stores.


There are other handy features for the stock trade:  stock alerts, on-screen forms, stock quotes and research and something new -- Instant Messaging using Yahoo with on-screen customer service to IM with; however, if you're like me and skeptical of hackers lurking, you shouldn't IM to talk about your money.


Their customer service is quick to answer the phone and very knowledgeable.  
Turnaround for emails is 24 hours.  
In my opinion, Etrade should move to the head of the class.  
it seems they are doing everything right to get more customers.

		I attend CTU and it is an excellent school. 
I have attended a campus based school and didn't learn nearly as much as I am learning now. 
It is not easy to get an "A" especially in the Software Engineering program. 
It is a must that you study or you will fail.I am graduating in June and Can't wait. 
I already have a position lined up which pays $60,000. 
I am also about to be accepted into a great campus based graduate school. 
Not to shabby for an online degree.

		UMUC's quality of education plummeted faster than Enron stock. 
One reason was that UMUC's key administrators weren't paying attention. 
There are numerous complaints lately that UMUC is tapping teachers to teach courses outside their area of expertise and without a credential in the assigned field. 
For example, there is an anthropology teacher who also teaches biology, IFSM, psychology, and sociology. 
There is a teacher of African American history under fire because his experience in that field is questionable. 
English teachers are called upon to instruct speech as well as philospohy, and maybe math. 
Government teachers are assigned history courses too. 
And most of the psychologists are assigned sociology, because everyone knows it's practically the same thing. 
UMUC saves money by assigning 3 or 4 subjects to one teacher. 
As a student though we should know the competence and experience of the persons assigned to teach our classes. 
UMUC is also taking flak because their teachers are older, out-of-touch with developments in their field of instruction, not representing the diversity of the student population UMUC serves and unable to find work at other colleges (which is why they're at UMUC). 
In a related incident in DE PSYCH 436 Introduction to Clinical Psychology upper-level undergraduate students learned from another teacher that their clinical psychology teacher, M. Sadler, had a degree in psychology but also that his license to practice had been revoked for unprofessional and unethical conduct. 
What message does that send enthusiastic students looking forward to a career in psychology? 
UMUC provided really good qaulity education until about 5 years ago. 
The administrators need to know why and how the wheels came off. 
They also need to know how to get and keep good teachers and stop highly qualified teachers from leaving for more money and better working conditions.

		DeVry - Serious about Success, Not SEX. 
So if I had a second chance in life, I would go to a community college, learn computer like the others, have alot more prettier girls in my book of love, still be skilled and certified in what I want, get a Tech job on the side and in the real world, and save that $30,000 I owe. 
Who needs to know so much computers? 
Not even the POPE. 
So, to put it short, if you go to DeVry, and focus on learning and not F!!cking, you'll have a great career, but also end up paying loans for 10 years that could equal a brand new car note. 
Or you can enjoy life and see sunlight, have a wife and a girlfreind and some baby mama drama.. AMEN..

## Topic: Egroups...You'll Be Glad You did!!.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I joined Egroups about 2 yrs. ago. 
I was searching for a list on marriage and came across many that suited my needs. 
I now belong to seven egroups boards. 
Egroups offers such a vast range of groups...there is something for everyone. 
It is easy to join and easy to navigate. 
You can choose to receive individual emails or have them sent to you in digest form. 
You can even chose to read your mails at the site only. 
If you are busy or going away, you can go into your account and go "no mail" for a while. 
I have met friends that will be my in my life forever. 
It is unbelievable to anyone who has never joined a group like this...so join and find out for yourself! 
I've gotten together with people I've "met" on egroups and will be soon meeting more. 
I've made snail mail and phone buddies with several other people as well. 
If you have a specific interest go to http://www.egroups.com  and perform a search...I'm sure you'll be glad you did. 
Now, go...make new friends!!

		A University without a library or librarian cannot call itself a University. 
DeVry is just a mere institution. 
Look at Harvard, Stanford, and even local state schools! 
They all value their libraries enough to have actual professional staff. 
DeVry is a sad sad place. 
The education is worthless. 
Don't do it. 
You are all too smart for falling in this trap.

## Topic: Onelist and eGroups Together: Is It Any Better?.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I joined the Onelist email list community a couple of years ago and had my problems and rewards with it, but now that it has merged with eGroups, is it that much better? 
I haven't had any problems signing in and being recognized and if I forget my password, they send the code quickly so I can make a new one. 
That is a great improvement!


With Onelist there were server glitches once in a while so no messages went through for a couple of hours or much longer. 
Imagine how frustrating it was to finally receive a hundred messages from the members of your category! 
Many people left because of such problems or not being recognized as a member so they would have to rejoin for free. 
It happened to me, but not with eGroups, knock on wood. 


What changed?


eGroups/Onelist claims over a hundred refinements to their system and here are some of them. 
Onelist members, now also eGroups members, have more storage space for bigger communities, 20 MB of it to share files and pictures. 


The message archives are easier to browse, no longer given to you in 25-message installments.   


A great new feature is the ability  to chat with other members of your selected community. 
I haven't used it, but I'm not one for chat rooms. 
I'm sure it's much appreciated by people wanting to shoot the breeze.


Other features include: email moderation, where the list owner/creator approves of how the list is run, customized settings of the list in its categorization, a more informative help center, better search engine  so you can find the list you want and not even see the adult-content lists if you want, and a dozen languages to be translated in. 

 
My Advice

This is a wonderful way to guarantee you will have mail and someone you can choose to respond to or to ignore. 
If you want to just 'lurk', without participating in the discussions, you can, although some moderators may request that you don't after a while. 
I've had my run-in with a moderator for the opposite reason, though, and she took the side of a lurker who seemed to only be on the list to harass me.


I suggest you begin a list of your choice that is around 30 to 50 members and to receive messages in digest form if the volume of mail intimidates you. 
Look at the message archives first to see how active the group is or maybe read a few messages to see if it really interests you. 
There are a few lists for Epinions members, also, but I've forgotten if they are listed there anymore or you must be invited.


There is a tour you can take when you go to their main page and it will help you to decide if this email list is something you want to try. 
Just be forewarned that it can be addicting just like Epinions. 
At least it doesn't have the glitches and delays, though, despite its huge membership. 
So is it better now? 
Yes, definitely!

## Topic: You Can Find Any Group You Want Right Here.
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I don't even remember now how I cam across this place, I believe I was looking for freebie and found it that way.


If there is a particular thing that you are interested in you can type that in the search engine and it will bring up all the groups that there are listed for that subject.


For example, if you wanted to join a freebie club you could put that in there and it will list the clubs that send out alerts to these things.


Who should not join?  
People that do not like to get tons of e-mail, although you have a preference here of web only, individual em ails, and digest.  
If you choose individual e-mail then you are likely to be swamped, depending on the group that you choose. 


Some of the groups are by invite only so you have to apply for membership and they decide if they want you. 


There has been a lot of problems with all the groups that I belong to getting spam mail.  
This is where a person signs up only to spend for profit information out into the groups. 
They are quickly booted off the group.


To Join E Groups you have to register and put in the e-mail address where you want your e-mail to go to. 
Pick a password like most everywhere else and off you go.


Good luck and I hope that you can find a group that you are interested in. 
There are a ton out there.


And by the way, you can even start your own group.

## Topic: eGroups -- natural enemy of Epinions.
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            This eGroups thing is a fine service. 
It's not as good since Yahoo! 
took it over, of course, but I'll talk about that later.


What eGroups is all about and why you should go there right now.


Well, go there after you read and rate this thing, of course, but you do need to head over to eGroups soon. 
Why? 
It's a great place for people with similar hobbies to meet and exchange messages, links, files and the like. 
Let's say you like mutts. 
Cool! 
There's a group over there for that. 
Like the Atari 7800? 
You'll find a group for that, too. 
Are you the wife of a trucker? 
Indeed, you'll find a support group.


The point is, if you've got an interest, you'll likely find a group for it at eGroups. 
The site is huge, has a ton of members, and a lot of very active groups. 
At it's heart, eGroups is rather like a large bulletin board with a couple of twists. 
Sure, you can post messages and all that, but you can also get a condensed digest of them e-mailed to you daily, or get new messages mailed as soon as they're posted.


Better yet, you can post files and links to other sites that folks in your group might want to visit. 
Now, here's where Yahoo! 
screwed it up when it took over the site a couple of months ago -- file sharing isn't as easy as it used to be. 
For some reason, I've gotten a lot of messages telling me that my "group has reached it's daily limit" when trying to download a file. 
This message appears constantly and, when it doesn't, I've noticed that larger files tend to cut off before they're downloaded.


I'm sure Yahoo! 
will get around to solving this problem, but it's a big pain right now. 
I remain hopeful, though, that things will get back to normal before too long. 
I think. 
Maybe.


This site is also respectful of people's anonymity in groups. 
You can e-mail the person who posted a message directly, but the complete e-mail address won't be shown to you. 
It's hard to figure out someone's direct e-mail address at any time, see, and that's a nice feature.


This site, also, integrates with Yahoo! 
Messenger so that you can tell if members of your groups are logged into the pager or not. 
Chat it up with them through the Yahoo! 
Messenger if you want.


Speaking of chatting, the site also supports chat rooms in each, individual group. 
These don't seem to be used to often in any of the groups I've joined, but maybe other folks out there have found very active chats. 
I wouldn't know if that's the case or not.


Why Epinions will hate you if you use eGroups.


Okay, who around here has joined an "Epinions reading circle" set up at eGroups? 
Come on. 
Raise your hands. 
Don't be shy.


For those who don't know, reading circles have been set up all over the place at eGroups for the express purpose of exchanging links to stuff written at Epinions. 
It's one of those "you read mine and I'll read your's" types of things.


Epinions has announced that it doesn't like these groups and wants to get rid of those groups. 
I only mention this because I find it funny. 
So, Epinions wants to get rid of reading circles, huh? 
Is that the same Epinions that hasn't updated my royalties for the past five days or so? 
Is that the same Epinions that shut down in January only to come back with a site that looks and works horribly? 
Is that the same company? 
It is? 
Well, screw Epinions, then.


Now, without getting into whether or not I personally belong to a reading circle, let me just mention that these things have every right to exist. 
What's wrong with people getting together, discussing the news of the day, complaining about the site, and posting links to new Epinions? 
Nothing, so far as I can tell.


I realize the last half of this thing has turned into an editorial, but I feel this is the place for it. 
Why? 
There are a heck of a lot of reading circles over at Epinions, and I know that a lot of members of this "community" are well aware of that. 
I'm sick of Epinions, which is treating writers here pretty badly these days and having trouble keeping its site from crashing, griping and whining about such minor problems as "those evil reading circles." 
How's this, folks? 
Fix the problems with the site, then start investigating to see if there's some real abuse going on out there. 
Makes sense to me.


Conclusion.


I've enjoyed my time over at eGroups. 
Where else can I find old time radio show addicts (go Lum &amp; Abner) and Atari 7800 fans in the same spot? 
If you're like me and live in a fairly rural area, spots like eGroups can be a Godsend -- you won't find that many old time radio fans and Atari 7800 players in these parts, but I can sure connect with a lot of them at eGroups.


That site has managed to bring a lot of diverse groups to one spot and really create a unique sense of community in each, individual group that's set up. 
Better yet, setting up a group that's tailored to your particular interests is a breeze -- just start it for free, invite your friends, and off you go. 
This service is easy to use and can be a lot of fun. 
You're sure to find a group you like over there and, if you can't, just create your own. 
Great!

## Topic: eGroups Let's You Stay In Touch With People Near &amp; Far.
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I?
ve been a member of the free web service eGroups (also known as Onelist) since April 2000 and so far I love it. 
But, with any online service or any service as a matter of fact there are downsides. 


Joining eGroups is easy, fast and a great way to meet other people with the same interests as you. 
You first have to become a registered member (http://www.egroups.com/register) with eGroups before joining any group or making your own. 
You?
ll need to give them the email address you want your mail to go to, pick a password, and accept their user agreement and hit continue. 
After you reply to your confirmation message you?
re on your way to making new friends. 
To keep all your eGroups in one place you can put the My Groups page in your favorites. . 


One of the downsides and this happens in any aspect of life is there are personality conflicts between some members of the group. 
There are a few groups I?
m in where a few members might get upset over something someone else said. 
Usually the owner or one of the co-owners (moderators) can straighten up in no time. 
If it comes down to it you can either delete them form the group or use the ban feature. 
You put in their email address and this keeps them from every joining your group ever again. 


You may also moderate the messages anyone in the group can post. 
With this you go to their email address and hit ?
This member?
s posts are moderated?. 
This way you can let only posts that you think are appropriate to go to the whole group. 
You can do this for individual members or for the whole group at anytime. 


Another problem with eGroups (all online services have this problem at times) is sometimes the site is down and you can?
t get in to read posts or even send one out without it coming back to you saying it can?
t be sent. 
Another problem with eGroups, at times when you make a post it never goes up at all. 
The eGroups customer service is not great at all. 
I've emailed them a few times about problems in groups not posting messages and I never heard back from them. 


You have the option of making your group open the public (members and non members can read and post freely), for members only (members can only post). 
You can also put your club on open membership or restricted (you accept only the members you want to join). 
You can have your club listed in the directory or unlisted. 


Some other great features eGroups offers it members are a chat room where the members of your group can go in a private chat room anytime of the day and chat there instead of posting messages. 
One of the groups I own/moderate does this and it works out great. 
This is only available if the owner leaves the link at the group open to all members. 
There is a place to post links to your web pages, favorite sites or anything else you want to share with the other members. 
You can also upload files to the group that are too big to post to the whole group. 


There is also the calendar feature where members of your group can put important dates they wish to let the other members of that group know about. 
You can also set it to send out an email to the whole group before your important date arrives. 
This is only available if the owner leaves the link at the group open to all members. 
There is a poll feature where you can make a poll and have the other members vote. 
This is only available if the owner leaves the link at the group open to all members. 


You can get the posts to your groups in 3 forms?
daily digest (you get one email with 1-25 emails in it). 
Depending on how many posts there are made a day you may get more then one digest a day. 
You can also get individual emails (each post emailed to you separately). 
Last but not least you can go ?
web only? 
and read from the site. 
I do ?
web only? 
in the mommy group I?
m in because it mush easier when you want to reply to the posts individually. 
I could do emails but some days we post 200 times a day and that?
s too much email in my inbox. 


I own a mommy group for parents who have babies born in 1999. 
I have that one set so the replies to posts made go to the whole groups and not just the author. 
If you don?
t want your group set up to be a discussion group you have the option to set it so the replies to posts already made go to the author and not the whole group. 


I help moderate an epinions group with fellow epinionator awoolcott where only posts for write-offs can be made. 
If you have a write-off idea you can post your suggestions here and the other members who want in can reply to your post. 
The only other posts that can be made are the links to write-offs you participated in. 


You can make or find a group on anything that interests you. 
There are groups for epinions members, cat lovers, dog lovers, baseball, football, wrestling, cars, stocks, NSYNC, favorite shows, bands, singers, travel, books, Dean Koontz, Stephen King, cooking and recipe groups and so much more.  


I would recommend eGroups to anyone who wants to ?
chat? 
with other people with the same interests as them. 
It?
s free, easy to join, easy to understand and navigate and keep in touch with people from around the world.

		I have been a UMUC student for 2.5 years now. 
I started my education at a main stream college and then kind of lost my way. 
I have had some great educational experiences here at UMUC. 
My main complaint with UMUC is the disorganization among their administration. 
I live in MD! I should be able to get a hold of someone to give me a straight answer on what classes I need to take in order to graduate. 
I have been told several times now several different things concerning what I need in order to graduate. 
I was supposed to be done May of this year, and then I found out I needed 12 more credits. 
I then went to work trying to complete these credits over the Summer. 
I thought I would be done on August 18th of this year. 
I found out this morning that I need yet another class. 
I am supposed to start Graduate school this Fall (not at UMUC). 
If I am not done with my classes by August then I have to defer for a year! 
I have already paid a nonrefundable acceptance fee to this graduate school. 
Moreover, I just want to be done with my undergraduate degree. 
I will have enough (120) credits by the end of the Summer. 
How can these people just lie to adults about their futures???

		I have to give UOP a four star rating. 
I am graduating in May with by BIS degree and have a great experience with them. 
I have learned more than I ever learned at my traditional school where I earned my A.S. I have done more work and retained more knowledge studying at UOP five hundred times more than I did at the other University's and Community Colleges I have attended. 
I think some people don't like to accept the fact that learning can be done via the Internet and satellite classrooms. 
IT is strange though because they are probably the same people who are setting up web training and surveys within their company's. 
It may be hard to accept for some but it is a growing discovery that humans are capable of learning without being hand fed the answers to everything; we can be self-motivated and self-disciplined to the point of actually learning without an instructors face to their name or ever setting foot in a four walled room but in the convenience of our own offices and homes.

I would have never had the chance to further my education if I had to attend a ground campus for all my classes. 
I have a son, husband, home, full-time job and life to live. 
I only have the wee hours of the night to study and attend class and traditional schools do not offer this flexibility.

I read all the bad comments about the school and it saddens me. 
I am sure that people have had bad experiences at UOP but students have had bad experiences at every school. 
Schedules change, instructors stink, prices rise, etc. 
I know the future will only be filled with more students graduating from schools that have flexible schedules and advanced technology that allows them to provide such an atmosphere. 
If traditional schools do not jump on the bandwagon they may find themselves short a few students.

Anyway, I loved my experience and my employer is SO happy for me to be graduating and they support UOP degrees 100%. 
I will no longer be passed up for a promotion due to not having a degree. 
I am more educated and confident now and when I encounter someone who disagrees I will never cower away but stand up for my degree and what I have learned.

            Egroups is without a doubt the best site to create your own interactive mailing list. 
I say interactive because unlike other places, Egroups allows the members of a list to communicate with each other. 


I am a member of several groups, many just about Epinions. 
These groups allow the members to discuss the site and share new reviews. 
I'm also a member of several wrestling groups and I even manage a few lists of my own.


Egroups really does have something for everybody. 
I really can't find anything bad to say. 
Creating an account and managing it is extremely easy. 
I'd recommend this site to everybody on the internet.

		DeVry is not accredited in Texas. 
It is granted permission by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, but it still is not regionally accredited like all state and private universities in Texas. 
Just because the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board gives DeVry the authority to label itself a University, does not make Devry credible as an institution of higher learning.

Quoting DeVry website: "DeVry University* is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association"
Quoting The Higher Learning Commission Website: The Higher Learning Commission accredits, and thereby grants membership in the Commission and in the North Central Association, to degree-granting educational institutions in the North Central region: Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Mexico, South Dakota, Wisconsin, West Virginia, and Wyoming
So before attending DeVry check the accreditation in your state thoroughly, to make sure that the degrees validity will not be compromised in the real world.

		I took several classes at UoP before transferring to another school. 
The only reason I transfered was cost and that was only because I wanted to finish some basic classes and wanted to save money doing it. 
Both the community college I transfered to and now the state university I am completing my degree at took my credits. 
While yes you do have to deal with classmates that don't do their share, the professors take that into consideration and I did 10x's more work for my UoP online classes than I do at a traditional school.

            I joined a mailing list for mom's about 3 years ago.  
I made so many good friends on this list!  
Truly some of my best friends I have met online  through email lists!  
I am a member of several different groups now.  
And let me just tell you how helpful it is having so many people to turn to!  


I am not saying you will have the same expierience as I have had!  
I also joined a couple of other egroup lists, and had a terrible time with them.  
And, for some reason everytime I try to unsubscribe from a group, there is an error, and it takes month's to unsubscribe.  
I contacted technical support, and really received no help whatsoever.  
So that is one bad point.


However, I have had a 99% positive experience using Egroups (formerly Onelist).  
I always have friends at my fingertips, if I need to ask a question, or get advice.  
It has really helped me out in so many way's!


I really don't know of any other alternate email list communities to suggest.  
If you do, please let me know :)  But I really recommend checking out Egroups!  
They have so many different lists to choose from, I'll bet you find something you are interested in!

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            eGroups is a free email group service, similar to ListBot and CoolList, which is available world-wide, making it easier to join and create groups and meet great people. 
I first joined eGroups a few years back when it was known as Onelist and it is as easy to use now as it was then.


There are literally thousands of groups for you to join, ranging from discussion groups on music to ones on sports. 
There are even some groups for Epinions! 
So, no matter what your interest is, eGroups sure won?
t fall short on that!


To sign up for a group, or to create your own, you have to register for eGroups services. 
The good thing is that eGroups does not require as much information from you as most web services do. 
All eGroups asks from you while registering is your gender, date of birth, country and zip code (if you reside in the US). 
Displaying this information to the public is totally optional! 
However, if you want other people to get to know you better, you can show this information (and a lot more) on your member profile. 
Some people may ask you to complete your member profile in full before accepting you into their group. 
You also have to reply to a confirmation email to ensure that no one signs you up for junk mail on their own.
 

JOINING A GROUP
To find a group of your interest you can either search using keywords or browse the directory. 
Once you?
ve found a group you like, just click the subscribe link, choose your membership options and you?
re done. 
It?
s that simple. 


If you subscribe to a busy eGroup with lots of members, your inbox will probably be flooded with hundreds of email for you to wade through everyday. 
Doesn't sound too good, does it? 
No Problem! 
You can either choose to receive digests (many messages in one email which are sent in batches of 25 or daily, whichever comes first) or read the mail directly from the web (no mail in your inbox). 
Messages can be posted to the list from the eGroups website as well as from your normal mail program.



CREATING A NEW GROUP
There are three types of groups: Unmoderated groups where members can post freely and all messages are sent immediately, Moderated groups where the moderator approves of each message before it is distributed to the list members, and groups for newsletters or announcements where only the moderator can post messages.


If you want, you can list your new group in the public directory and it will be available for everyone to search for. 
If you choose this option you will probably have more members in your group. 
However, if you want your group to be private (e.g. one for your family) and only want invited people to join (or attempt to join), you'll be better off choosing not to be listed in the directory. 
Enter some keywords and a description of your group and you're on your way!


Its really easy to invite people to join your list! 
eGroups has a feature which enables you to do so simply by entering the email addresses of those you wish to invite- up to 50 at a time. 
You can also directly subscribe members, and not send invitations, but the new members can leave by replying to the welcome email. 
If you have a website, you can find the HTML code for a "join group" button on eGroup's website.


Moderators are people who make sure no one abuses the group and everything goes smoothly. 
The list owner is usually the only moderator but more moderators can be added. 
Each group has a files area in which members can upload files of up to 20MB in total, and up to 5MB each. 
These files can be mailed to members, if desired, on subscription, unsubscription, every two weeks or every month, or a message can be sent to the list members announcing the file and they can download it from the website themselves.


You have full control over who joins yout group and, if you want, you can ban obnoxious people from joining.


If you do not want any text or banner ads on messages sent to the group, you can sign up for the No Advertising Option for $4.95 a month.



eGroups has recently been acquired by Yahoo and I sincerely hope that they don?
t ruin eGroups like they did with Geocities and Webring.org. 
But for right now, they're pretty good!

		I'm beginning the health administration at UOP and I start next week. 
I must say, i'm having more problems with this school already then any other school i've ever attended. 
I keep having to call the IRS (which i've never had to do) to request info from them and then having them say 'well we've never had a school request something like that....'. 
Overall, i'm left with having doubts of even attending this school because I haven't even started attending classes yet and i'm already having this much trouble and its causing so much stress. 
Not to mention, I talked to a lady who works in the financial aid dept. 
today and she sounded b*tchy. 
That was just icing on the cake.

            You can remain anonymous while forming complex and intimate relationships with total strangers.  
Talk about things you thought you would never share in a million years.  
Got a fetish?  
There's an egroup for it.  
There is probably an egroup set up for discussion of any topic of interest in your life, even those you thought you were alone with.


As a group member, you control whether people can see your profile, which email address the messages come to, whether you get individual emails or daily digests.  
You can even choose "no mail" and your emails will be stopped.  
Some groups allow you to read the messages on the egroups website instead of getting emails.


One thing I would like to see improved at egroups is the number of "dead" groups where people have joined the group but long forgotten it and nobody every posts any messages.  
You join the group and wait for a few days to see some messages.  
Amid the crickets chirping, you offer a tentative "Hello?" 
and get no response.  
This could mean that everyone on the group has put themselves on "no mail" and simply forgotten about it or that the group was created so long ago that the member emails are all inaccurate now and no valid email addresses are left to receive the messages.  
I'd like to see egroups do something to clean up these ghost towns so people don't waste their time joining them.  
I think there is a tag line on the group description that says "Last message posted:" so you can see if the group is active or not.  
But if you see a last message posted date that is long ago, you don't know if that is because the group is dead or if maybe the members are just waiting for someone like you to come along and liven things up.


If there doesn't happen to be a topic related to what you're looking for, it's very easy to start your own group and see who comes out of the woodwork!


I belong to several egroups and I moderate two.  
As moderator, you can control the group as much or as little as you want.  
You can determine whether your members can post and respond to messages or whether it will be a "broadcast only" type board.  
You can moderate all messages and control which messages make it to the members.  
You can limit the membership of your group or make it open to everyone and you can knock people out of your group at any time.  
	Oh, the power!


Seriously, if there's a topic you'd be interested in talking about, chances are there are others out there who'd be interested as well.  
The satisfaction of finding people who relate to you--or finding lively controversy if you enjoy debate--is unbelievable.  
You'll make lifetime friends whom you may never even meet.

            I started using eGroups when it was still called Onelist.

The site is used for starting and subscribing to email lists.


It has a lot of different features and tons of lists on all kinds of topics ranging from tame to the bizarre.  
I belong to about 40 and own 2.


OPTIONS:
Each list that you are subscribed to has a page where you can look up other members, post, chat, share files, and more. 
They also have options that set your message status to web only/no mail, digest, individual emails, or unsubscribe.  
This feature comes in handy when you need to be out of town.

Some lists have messages archives that are able to be read by anyone. 
Others are hidden and are only available to those who are subscribed.


I would recommend egroups to those who are looking for more email lists to subscribe to.

            eCircles is a flexible community service that allows you to stay in touch with friends and family.  
Here are my favorite features:

Easy set-up  You can get a lean, mean eCircle set up in just 10 minutes.  
Set-up the basic structure and expand later.


Easy tracking of all your eCircles.  
Once you create one eCircle, you'll want to create more.  
Because eCircles grow by invitation only, your eCircles will remain private from one another.  
Popular eCircles include family, club, workplace, and friends groups.


The photo albums kick butt.  
I've used online albums before, and this is one of the best.  
You can upload up to five photos at a time.  
Each photo album gets a cover photo (the first photo uploaded) and a title.  
When you click on the album, you get a page of thumbnail photos.  
Click on a photo; not only do you get the enlargement, you also can leave comments about the photo.  
Great for future geneologists!  
(eCircles is currently offering a free print service, too, but I'm sure there is a fee involved somewhere.)


Your group members without e-mail can be included in your contact database.  
However, all non-internet group contacts are mismashed into your primary contact database (like an address book)!  
I'd rather have the ability to tag non-internet members as being attached to a specific group or groups.


The announcements features is the best way to keep your group up-to-date.  
Your most recent announcement will always appear on the group homepage.  
Save less important information for Discussions.


Discussions are just like using a newsgroup or message board.  
However, do warn newbies in a "Read This Before Posting" thread to uncheck the e-mail to everyone in group defaulted feature unless they really want everyone to get an e-mail!  
(I really think eCircles should have this defaulted as unchecked.)  
Use Discussions to create your own private FAQ.  
As I was tweaking my groups, I discovered that some features would be difficult for newbies (i.e., 95% of my family group!) 
to implement, so I posted several tips in FAQ format (Q and A).


I really like the avatar feature (select your character), but no one uses it except me.  
In ZDTV chat, everyone is given a different default character; being a character you hate gives you motivation to pick a new avatar.  
eCircles should consider doing this.  
Right now, all new members are defaulted as white smiley faces.


You can view all members of the group by going to the My Group page.  
They're presented as characters, which is fun.


Click on Invite More People to send out more invitations.  
Tip: do use the nickname email@email.com format so that nicknames appear with their characters rather than a nondescript e-mail address.


One of the best features is the event calendar.  
Not only can you post birthdays, anniversaries, etc., you can invite people to your event!  
Say you're planning a party.  
You can send an invitation including an rsvp form.  
You can add maps, comments, and create multiple choice questions like "Would you prefer...?" 
"Beer, wine, soda".  
eCircles did a fine job with their invitations.  
I can't wait to start planning my next party.


eCircles includes more features like News and Text Chat that I don't really use.  
I believe the News feature would be great for informal investment clubs, though.


I give eCircles four out of five circles.

		I just received my MIS in IT Management and I have to say I feel that I accomplished something of personal significance. 
Yet, as with any academic institution, there are pros and cons.


My experience:

The Pros: the course sequence in my masters was well-planned. 
By the last class, I had a new vocabulary and pretty much the rudiments of a new skill set (I work in education and had little background in information systems, yet I was able to get up to speed relatively quickly). 
Most of my fellow program students were sincere, smart, hard working people. 
Every now and then, someone would flake out, but this was usually do to things going on in their work/personal lives. 
And having worked on professional teams in non-academia, I have not found it to be much differrent. 
I would say about 4/5 teachers were competent professionals and hard-working teachers. 
That is pretty good for any school in my opinion.


The Cons: The weekly assignments require rigid discipline. 
We all had day jobs in the MIS program, and coming home after 10+ hours to spend 1-2 hours writing discussion question answers was not what I would have preferred. 
But that's the discipline you accept if you want an advanced degree while you're working. 
One or two of my courses were just lousy (Programming and Project Management--yet I got an A and a B+ respectively, so I'm not saying this out of misplaced resentment).


Overall: I think it's worth the money. 
But as the wise man said: "Garbage in / garbage out."

            Egroups is a free e-mail list community.  
You can search for lists to join for things that interest you.  


For example if you are into beanie babies you are sure to find plenty of lists that interests are buying/selling/talking about beanies :) Plus you get to meet many other people that share the same interests. 


Even topics you might never want to discuss or take place in, well you can probably find those here too.  


Egroups shows you what groups you have joined and lets you manage how you want to recieve your e-mail. 
You can revieve HTML or Plain e-mail plus tell them if you want digest mode(where you get all of one day's e-mail in one e-mail from that group) or individual(where you get every single indivdual mail) or no mail(where you can read the mail from the website) or chose unsubscribe to leave the list.  


I have joined many lists at egroups and have owned a few lists too.  
It is a easy, free service to use.

## Topic: Make Enough Money For A Brighter X-Mas For A Child.
## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I joined egroups about a month ago, so far it has been working out great.  
You can go to the egroups.com homepage and search for different groups to join.  
They are especially great if you want more people to see and read your opinions.  
I have so far joined 2 groups.  
One is the Epinions Reading Circle, and the other is a new one by babycarrots called Epinions Money Makers.


To join you just simply have to go to egroups.com and search for a groups that you would like to join.  
After you have found one to join you send an email and wait to see if you are accepted into the group.  
I have not heard of anyone not being accepted as of now.  
Probably if you have an unacceptable amount of tickets or something along that line you may not be able to join, but otherwise it is for everyone.


Let me tell you a little how it works.  
After you have joined you write opinions (or you can use your old ones if you do not write new one frequently) copy and paste the URL into an email that is addressed to your group such as EpinionsMoneyMakers@egroups.com.  
If you are not a member your email will be returned to you.  
That I really like, because then just any John Doe can't just send out emails with links to the groups hoping everyone will read them.  
You describe in your email what the links are to.  
For instance: "Here is my newest on egroups.com".  
Then you just send it.  
You can change your preferences by going to the site and choosing whether to have a digest or single emails.  
I really like the digest, that way you get 25 emails in on single email instead of 25 separate emails from everyone in the group.  
I have my digest sent twice a day.  
So I get 50 emails with anywhere from 1-5 or more links in it.  
You are not required to read every single opinion but if you submit 2 you should read 2, submit 3-read 3....etc.


First I want to talk about the first egroup that I joined.  
That was the Epinions_Reading_Circle.  
This is a relatively good group.  
I have found that it may have too many members for me though.  
As of right now their is 168 members.  
So plan on getting alot of email if you join this one!  
It does take alot of time to read and rate all of these so plan on about 4 hours a day just to this group.


The other group that I just recently joined is alot nicer to be in, in my opinion that is!  
Right now it has about 45 members and the goal is 110.  
Babycarrots is the moderator and does a bery good job at it.  
She enforces the rules and everyone is limited to 1 post a day with 2 links or 2 posts with 1 link in each.  
I find this so much better, I do not get overloaded with so many reads.


Egroups is a really great place to get your name out on epinions.  
You can read so many without having to look for them.  
Also great people are in these groups and you will make friends and expand your WOT.


I have made so much more money and gotten so many more hits since I joined egroups.  
Now I have extra Christmas cash, what am I going to do with this extra money you ask?  
Well, I was going to sponsor a family but I live in a smaller town and they don't have anything of that kind.  
So I was in good ol' Wal-Mart the other day and noticed that they have a Christmas tree in the entry with a bunch of paper ornaments with gender and ages on them.  
So I am going to buy gifts for these Children that are so helplessly without toys this year.  
That will be my good deed for December!!  
Also, all of the money I have made in November and that I make the first half of December will go towards this and I am going to match it so that I can sponsor more than one kid.  
So thank you for helping me helps someone else in need! 
:~)

## Topic: Nice bonus, substandard service
## Score: 3.0
## Recommended: No

            
            
            
            Etrade seemed like a great choice for an online broker.  
I am going to use it for no-fee mutual fund purchasing.  
Stock transaction fees are higher than other Internet brokers at $14.95/trade.  
When I signed up I also got a $175 bonus ($100 Etrade, $75 Gomez.com) for creating an account.  
That is a nice incentive.  
However, my experience thus far has been less than satisfactory.


I received an email stating that my account would be active within 2 days.  2 days later, my initial investment cleared the bank.  
However, I could not access my account.  
When I called 5 days later, customer service said it 'must be a technical problem' on my end, and transferred me to technical support.  
Technical support determined that it was not 'user error', rather a problem with my account because of my application.  
Technical support put me on hold again and transferred me to the new accounts department.  
For some strange reason, they needed to verify my birthdate and occupation.  
I gave them the same answers that were on my application.  
They then proceeded to activate my account, but it would still not be available for another 24 hours.  
I think it had nothing to do with my application; they were simply confused. 


The support person apologized for the delay, but said they were 'swamped with new account openings'.  
When I asked about why I should stay with 
Etrade, I was promised that it shouldn't happen again.  
I asked for free trades to compensate for their lack of service.  
They offered one, I upped that to two.  
I believe, as any kind of financial institution, you need to take care of your customers.  
They never informed me that there was any problem with my account.  
However, they had no problem cashing my check, without contacting me!


I am weary of any company that does not bend over backwards to serve new customers.  
How will they take care of their existing customers?  
Etrade should have offered me an incentive to stay; I shouldn't have had to ask.  
I was prepared to cancel my account, and told them so.  
After waiting on the phone over an hour to straighten out THEIR mess, I leave it up to you to decide whether this inconvenience is worth the bonus money.

            My son-in law, Barry, is the financial wizard of the Grouch clan.  
He was a visitn' the other day and asked, "Daddy BadBob, where do you keep all that money you get from the Social Security?"


"First Bank of Sealy Posture-Pedic!" 
I Said.


"You don't really keep it in your mattress do you?"


I replied, "Course! 
Don't trust no banks.  
Member a little sumthin called the crash of '29?"


"But, Daddy BadBob, this is the year 2000.  
Your money should be working for you in the stock market."


Barry went on fur bout 2 hours tellin' me how the stock market works.  
And when he was dun, all I culd say is, "THAT"S GAMBLIN!"


"No, No, Daddy BadBob it's called investing.


"Well doggies, young man!  
Sounds ta me like yur bettin' on a company - like ya would a racehorse that ya want ta come out a winner.  
Iffin it does good ya make money - if not ya lose."


"Daddy BadBob, that's an oversimplification.....


"Shutup!  
How do ya do this here investin'?"


Barry recommended sumthin called E-Trade.  
I gathered about 1000 Samolians from my Sealy and stuffed em into a pillowcase and got a cashiers-type check at the bank.  
Within a week I got my starter kit from E-Trade.


The nice folks at E-Trade gave me a secret name - FUH34557 - and a secret password GHJIUY. 
Note from BadBob: These are pseudo-type names ta protect my real E-Trade name of LKJ53900 and real password of DSEXCV.


Barry was all excited.  
He said, "Daddy BadBob, now it's time to do your research!  
The Internet has a wealth of information for you.  
You look like the Blue Chip / Dow Jones Industrial type to me.  
Seriously consider IBM or GM. 
But it is your decision.  
If you you're feeling frisky, you could try the high growth potential of the NASDAQ."


"No way am I goin' ta by any Nazdek - Arab type stocks!" 
I replied.


"What ever you decide, do you homework. 
And tomorrow we will buy your first stock."


With Barry out of the way, I got onta the Internet and started my research.  
Bein' an old horse racin' handicapper, I knew just where ta go. 
Ya need inside tips! 
Well, I found sumbody on the Internet ta steer me in the right direction - Sammy, the Penny Stock Wizard.


Just like the guy at the racetrack who goes, "Psssst, I got a horse for you!" 
Sammy said, "BadBob, I have one word for you - Stogies!"


"Huh?" 
I said.


"Yes, International Cigars.com is the stock for you - they sell Cuban Cigars on the Internet.  
Why pay hundreds of dollars per share for blue chips when this stock is only going for 2 cents a share?  
And I guarantee it will be a winner!"


Sammy made a lot of cents.  
Why, iffin that Stogie stock called ICC only went up ta a dollar, I wuld make bout 50 times my bet (I mean investment).


When the market opened the next mornin, I placed all my Mula on ICC. 
Yep, BadBob was the owner of 50,000 shares of ICC!


Barry came ta the cabin shortly after and said, "What did you decide on Daddy BadBob?"


"ICC!" 
I proudly proclaimed.


Barry responded, "That sounds impressive, I never heard of it, though."


"It's International Cigar.Com idiot! 
I think I own most of that company now!"  


"Daddy BadBob, you didn't!  
I thought we decided on IBM or...."


"Shutup and watch the ticker!" 
I told him.


Watch we did.  
ICC started soarin' ta 10 cents, ta 50 cents, ta a dollar!


"Wow, Daddy BadBob, you made $49,000!  
SELL!  
SELL!


"Be patient my yung friend, I said." 
And I turned off the puter and said, "We'll take look-see in the mornin'"

Barry left shakin his head.  
In the mornin, after the market opened, I took a gander at ICC.  
It was down ta 1 cent a share!  
A Fortune lost!


BadBob can be found -during the weekdays- starin' at his ticker hopin' that ICC will make a comeback.  
Hey!  
I got a stock ta reccomend ta ya....

The school recruits faculty my having them pay to take a class, then line them up on unsuspecting online students. 
I am surprised that the school remains accredited.

		I assume your ive is to make money in a field that interests you. 
Perceptions count; you must have something an employer wants, and he must know he wants it. 
If you want to make money and be accepted among your peers, your should be to graduate from a school with a football team rather than an unheard of school like the DEVRYs of this world. 
Public institutions get free advertising almost every night on the local news/sports casts. 
So you get built in name recognition of your school. 
Employers in your state are more likely to support (help fund) the public institutions of your state because they serve as incubators for the next generation of their employees. 
Their managers are more likely to be Alums of a Public Institutions (get the good old boy network on your side) If you are a High school student work hard to make yourself eligible for your states public university or college. 
If you are a recent graduate and cant get into a public college go to your local community college. 
My bet is that an associates degree from a community college is just as marketable as an associates degree from a private specialty school. 
(Did I mention that it is less expensive too?) Some (dare I say most?) community colleges have extension classes that allow you to gain transferable credits to a state 4 year institution. 
Lastly if none of these options meet your needs (I think you should re-evaluate your needs but!) by all means check out a private school such as DEVRY. 
What makes my opinion any better or worse than those others posted on this site? 
Well, lets see I am a 95, DEVRY graduate of the Phoenix, AZ. USA, BSEET curriculum. 
I am also a Retired Naval officer worked in the electronics field for 39 years now as a technician. 
As an officer I have had some management experience and have associated with other managers so I understand how they think. 
Much is made of DEVRYs, mainly by DEVRY, heavily hands-on focus. 
As a manager hiring an engineer, I would be more interested in depth of knowledge and understanding of the principles of engineering and science, and the ability to bring those principles to bear on problem solving rather than the ability to actually build the device. 
I have others, usually titled Technicians, to which I assign the duties of fabrication and testing. 
Lastly: I havent looked at DEVRYs curriculum in years. 
I found it to be pretty easy. 
It was thorough but it didnt tax my military electronics training too much. 
That may be because a BSEET degree is not an engineering degree. 
It is a Technician Degree. 
BS EETs generally serve as engineering technicians not engineers. 
That is left to those who have years of experience and or those with a minimum of a BSEE degree.

            eGroups/Onelist is a fantastic way to meet new people with common interests.  
Chances are, if you're interested in it, you can bet there's a mailing list for it on eGroups.  
A simple keyword search should lead you to what you're looking for, but be forewarned-- depending on what you're looking for, your search could lead you to quite a selection!  
Picking which list(s) to subscribe to can be difficult if you're unfamiliar with the community, so you may want to consider reading the archives(if permitted-- some list owners reserve this feature for list members, some list owners remove this feature so that no archives are kept) before joining a list.

You have three choices with eGroups as far as how to view the messages on your chosen group(s).  
One is having the messages sent directly to your email account, individually.  
Depending on the list, the volume of mail can sometimes be quite high, so this option may be a little discouraging, unless you have the time/desire to wade through multiple(sometimes 200+ a day on one list that I belong to) emails every day.  
A second option is to use the 'digest' feature-- this allows you to view the messages in a grouped format(25 messages per digest) directly in your email(in a single email form).  
This is recommended on high traffic lists.  
The third option is to read messages via the web(on the eGroups site).  
This option is only viable if the list moderator has set the list to store archives(as I mentioned above, some lists do not use the archive option, thus making it impossible to read via the web).  
You can post/respond to messages either directly from your email account or from the eGroups website.

eGroups now also offers a chat function for each list, so members of your list all have a place to go and chat if they wish.  
There is a section to host polls for each list, as well as a section for shared files, such as jokes or pictures.

So, if you're interested in talking with others about your hobbies, your children, your pets, or almost anything else you can imagine, eGroups is an excellant place to check out.  
I presently belong to 13 different lists and am enjoying every minute of it.  
Have fun!

		At the end of the day, anyone considering Capella (or any other school, for that matter) will have to make his or her own choice. 
I chose Capella and have no regrets whatsoever. 
I am now in my sixth quarter in the O and M PhD program, and have completed my residency requirement. 
I am getting a very high quality education and am receiving excellent support from faculty and administration alike. 
Every complaint or issue I have had has been quickly resolved with a simple phone call or email. 
But don't just take my word for it; consider as many well-respected, objective sources of opinions as you can gets your hands on, and THEN form your own opinion. 
Examples include regional accrediting bodies such as North Central (http://www.ncahigherlearningcommission.org/), the Sloan Consortium (http://www.sloan-c.org/), 
or Noel-Levitz (http://www.noellevitz.com/). 
I don't know why this site seems to attract people who have sour grapes with respect to Capella, and I don't know what motivates them to pretend they are a better judge of academic excellence than those who make their living assessing the academic quality of insitutes of higher learning. 
My advice is that you consider that they are entitled to their opinion, but that you do your homework in order to make an informed choice.

## Topic: Why Etrade
## Score: 5.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            Etrade in my opinion clearly distinguishes itself from other online brokers such as Ameritrade, Scottrade or Suretrade because of its commitments to serious investors and its wide sources of information for the average investor. 
My particular interests lie in tech and biotech stocks (obviously since i'm young and aggressive) and if you (like me) are searching for quick growth with as little risk as possible, your "source" can mean the difference between buying that new BMW in a year or getting a that 91 Ford Tuarus you saw advertised in a motel parking lot. 


Etrade compiles a list of "5-star" stocks available to members and despite recent fluctuations in the market, over the course of a year, these stocks are flying high. 
You should check out its knowledge centre as well. 
Most dissatisfied E-trade customers, from my personal experience, seem to be those who either cannot read or don't bother reading because all of the information a broker can tell you about trading stocks, options or whatever the case maybe, is on the site. 
If you don't like doing the "dirty work" yourself of digging through stock histories and evaluating them based on P/E ratios, historical highs and lows, recent news, industry strengths, technical data etc, then by all means, use a personal broker and pay more. 
However for me, the thrill of evaluating a stock on your own with E-Trade as your "personal guide" is one I wouldn't give up for anything, and so far, I've been very successful.


Also, if you are a short-medium term trader, main advantage to having an Etrade account are its Powertrade features. 
When you open an Etrade account, you can also ask, if u wish, for a 3-month free trial for powertrade and I highly recommend this. 
To renew your Powertrade account, you only have to make 30 trades every 3 months so if you trade on a speculative basis, you could probably make up those 30 trades in no time. 
The powertrade features include many of the features present in a daytrading account and each trade costs you only $5. 
Compare that with $15 with just a regular Etrade account, $7 with Ameritrade or $10 with Datek. 
There is also 24-hour customer support, after hours trading with Instinet from 4-6:30 P.M EST and a special Powertrade customer service line through which you can contact a broker with hardly any "on-hold" time. 
It is these additions that put Etrade a notch ahead of the rest of the online trading community. 
Ameritrade or any of the other wannabees are lagging way behind when it comes to E-Trade and its Powertrade options.


Bottom line: If you are a serious investor (i.e- plan on trading often), I highly recommend Etrade. 
If you are not an experienced investor and are simply looking to step cautiously into the market for a while, it really does not make much difference as to which broker will execute your trade. 
What matters more is the advice you receive and the due diligence you conduct towards picking your stocks. 
In this regard, online brokerages lag well behind their full service counterparts for obvious reasons especially for the new investor who does not know much about the market. 
However, for those of you who have traded before and are looking to save on trading costs, you will not be disappointed with E-trade as long as you read all the information they provide. 
Its customizable charts, free real time quotes, up-to-date company news flashes and other research tools are supplemented by a friendly online and telephone support team which is quite unlike my previous experience with Datek and a more recent yet equally unimpressive experience with Ameritrade. 
Is that more important than a $3 difference in trading costs if you are not a Powertrade user? 
You can decide that.


Regarding full-service brokerages (i.e- the kind where you have your own personal broker to give advice, place trades for you etc), there's nothing a broker can add which is not present in E-trade (unless he has inside information, which is of course illegal) so if you are prepared to look up information yourself and find out what stocks work best for you, then you will be saving quite a bit versus using that broker and paying those exorbitant trading costs, which do add up. 
In either case, remember to buy low and sell high, and not vice versa! 
Market conditions play very important roles in the price of a stock so if you feel you have got a winner, do not be discouraged by short term swings. 
Stick with it, just like Etrade has done over the past 10 years, and I'm sure you too will be a winner.

            prior to spring 2000 this is what i thought: Etrade is great for access to IPOs. 
The question is are you likely to get an allocation? 
They've got the most and best IPOs but not everyone gets a piece of it. 
They are obviously allocating to their best customers despite their democratic chantings. 
They've also got LOUSY customer service (only Wit Capital's is worse). 
Believe me. 
They also make you jump through a zillion hoops to just sign up for an IPO. 
For people with no life and who don't mind constantly reloading Etrade's web site to get the latest IPO news then this is for you.


Why do I tolerate this? 
Simply because if you get in on one of the hot IPOs you're golden. 
And for that it's worth it.

And do you know WHY they make this difficult for you? 
So that they get the top rankings in all the stupid Internet web site rankings (ie most visits, longest visits, etc.) and attract more customers and advertising dollars. 
(Remember I said that you had to constantly reload your screen? 
That translates to artificial hits.)


Other negatives: you need to enter your password each time you place, change or cancel an order. 
That's f*cking time consuming and annoying. 
You should be able to log in once and that's it.


Post spring 2000: the customer service folks are more friendly and helpful and most importantly, the ipo process, is more transparent. etrade now has expected pricing dates and times and expected order taking dates and times so you don't need to be glued to their web site. it's very systematized these days. very very nice. account opening process is also much easier. i've got to say that the only thing that still bothers me is the trading system and the email notification system. the former is a little buggy at times but the email notifications suck.


[-If you're not a day trader, I don't think you can really notice the difference between execution amongst all the OLBs (online brokers). 
And pretty soon they'll all be offering after hours and wireless trading.

-Price isn't really an issue either since the most it'll ever be is $30 per trade. 
If you're gonna quibble and say $30 is three times as much as $8 then you really haven't reckoned with $200+ trades at traditional brokerage houses. 

-So what sets them all apart? 
Just two things: Access to IPOs and customer service. 
For some people maybe it's three: access to research reports.

-Read my reviews on Fidelity, Schwab, Etrade, Wit Capital DLJdirect and Discoverbrokerage and merrill lynch direct.]

## Topic: Good for long term investors, not so good for speculators
## Score: 4.0
## Recommended: Yes

            
            
            
            Overall, E*Trade is not a bad service.  
They are reasonably priced, and they offer a lot of features.  
E*Trade offers certain features that other on-line brokerages don't offer.  
They allow trading of mutual funds, bonds, and options.  


As far as mutual funds go, they have a very large list of no load, no fee mutual funds to choose from.  
If you're a big fan of funds, this is a great brokerage.  
You can trade to your heart's content, and 90% of what you want to buy and sell won't cost you a cent.  
But, keep in mind that if you sell within 90 days of buying your fund, E*Trade does tack on a small fee.  
This isn't unusual, since the SEC and the fund managers are interested in preventing day-trading of mutual funds.


Their research is pretty good.  
They have a good bit of free research, including free real-time quotes and Morningstar reports.  
This being said, a lot of this info can be found in other places, like on Yahoo.com, morningstar.com, and cnnfn.com just to name a few.  
But, it's still nice to have research in the same place as your portfolio.


Portfolio management is good.  
Again, this is for investors, not speculators.  
Some of their portfolio management screens are only updated daily, but some are instant.  
You can get a good list of detailed account activity (and change whatsoever that happens in your account), and you can get a shot of your realized and unrealized profit  and  loss.  
Good reporting tools, but nothing to write home about (like Morningstar.com's Portfolio X-Ray).  


E*Trade makes it easy to become your primary investment vehicle.  
You can set up automatic transfers in and out of E*Trade, and have your money drop automatically into some good yielding money market funds.

Along these same lines, E*Trade also has an on-line bank, Telebank, which has excellent rates.  
If you're like most people, and you never step foot inside of a real bank building, then Telebank may be a good idea for you.  
You can use Telebank for your banking, and instantly move money into and out of your E*Trade account.  
Considering E*Trade's rates on money market accounts, this might be a good way to make some extra money on your idle cash.


Now, on to the part I'm sure you've read about quite a bit:  Customer service.  
Phone response time is terrible.  
If you're making trades based on minute-to-minute prices, and you need help or have a problem, forget it.  
You'll lose your shirt.  
Email response is good, but it's still about a day's wait.  
If you're a long-term investor, this kind of turnaround is fine, and the help via email is usually thorough and helpful.  


Trades are also not executed quickly.  
Sometimes they're fast, sometimes they can take hours.  
If you're dealing with a volatile stock, then this is a serious issue.  
But then again, if you're aggressively trading, E*Trade is not the place for you.


Overall, E*Trade is a decent service, but they still have some work to do.  
They're clearly positioned to work with long-term investors more than they are short term investors or speculators.  
At the same time, if they'd just improve their trade response time and their customer service, they'd be a good all-around brokerage.

		I have a question for you guys. 
I am considering going to Devry to further my education in either ECT, CET, or CIS while still in active duty in the US Navy. 
I'm an Aviation Electronics Technician, and I currently have 7 years experience working with electronic / mission systems, radar, micro-electronics, test benches, aircraft electronics and systems, etc, etc, - my question is...I have read that DeVry isn't so well suited for a "first degree" (ie, someone right out of high school). 
By the time I get out of the Navy, I'll have 10 years work experience in the electronics / computer field. 
I realize I still need an education to get a decent job, and was thinking that a degree from DeVry would fit with my work experience more than a standard Electrical Engineering, or Computer Science degree from a traditional college.


Keep in mind that money is not an issue for me, however time is a constraint. 
I'm a father / husband and need to keep supporting my family and go to school. 
This is the other reason devry sounds appealing. 
What do you guys think? 
I would appreciate everyones opinion. 
Is it better to get a traditional degree in EE / CS that doesn't really fit well with my previous work experience, or go to DeVry and get a degree in ECT, CET (or maybe CIS) that fits relatively better in regards to my work experience?


Thanks in Advance :)

		Thanks Capella!!!!
Now people can comment about their experiences with Capella, free from the other "Capella students" who have been frequenting this site trying to "challenge the integrity" of those of us who would like to tell about our bad experiences with this school.
So, now I will leave my original comment about Capella.
My gripe has to do with the initial contact I personally experienced at Capella University
I contacted Capella because I was interested in online learning. 
Capella did not fulfill a simple request that I had made to them. 
The request was to let me speak to someone who is currently in one of their graduate programs. 
I asked twice and they did not send someone to contact me like they told me they would. 
I have to start putting together my applications for graduate school by the end of the summer and I waited and waited but received no response to my request. 
I found Capella to be very unprofessional with the way they handled this. 
This does not bode well for the school. 
I hate bad service. 
I wondered why they didn't have anyone that I could speak with? 
Other schools have plenty of references that I am able to contact. 
I ultimately saw this as a blessing because I am no longer pursuing this school anymore. 
Because of my experience, I feel it's important to let others know about it. 
My initial experience with Capella wasn't good. 
This led me to look at what others are saying and "some" are saying that the school is lousy from their experiences also and they are currently in the program. 
This did not surprise me. 
Some of these students are also on there way to PhDs. 
Buyer Beware- Look around at the other reviews and ratings before you invest your hard earned time and money. 
Just google Capella and ratings or reviews and then you can make a more informed decision before you invest.. 
Besides, of course I have a Marxist Perspective when it comes to Capella. 
Why are there are no entrance requirements and 100% acceptance rate.
Gee, I wonder why that is? 
: ) Be wise and do your own investigation about the school. 
You'll see for yourself whether it's worth your investment.

		I suspect this site was created for some good reasons. 
In the computer age, we are in a fight for REAL DEGREE DIPLOMA vs FAKE DEGREE DIPLOMA. 
CAMPUS vs VIRTUAL SUCCESS. 
There is a bitter fight with scare tactics and propaganda to veer individuals away from certain schools of online learning. 
I think it is great that people have an area to vent, but the creator of this site and all of us should be careful not to conclude misleading information to individuals about AIU or any other school, unless we have concrete evidence at hand. 
I can understand someone being upset and reporting or telling others, but some people have had a great experience at AIU, UOP, and other institutions that have bad comments on the site. 
Each experience is different and my heart goes out to any misfortunes. 
I have a TRADITIONAL Bachelor of Science Degree and I'm strongly considering achieving my Master of Science online. 
To be factual, all higher learning advisors and administration usually have degrees in business, because all higher learning institutions are "for profit" and are ultimately "a business" just like any other business in the world. 
They are offering an education and marketable services, Right? 
When someone finds a free of tuition school, call me. 
I could really save on my Masters. 
There isn't a school diminished from flaw that cannot be placed on probation for the slightest unmet conditions. 
If a school meets the necessities of the US Department, then they are accredited and I doubt any employer would turn away a U S Department accredited degree. 
If so, they are idiots, because most employees don't have a traditionl or online degree for that matter. 
When it's all said and done our children in the future and mostly all schools(even highschool, and elementary) will be virtual in some regards in just a short time. 
Then what will empoyers, students, and other angered "for profit" schools in competition benefit from trying to put any degree or school in the "inadequate school pages of the worldwide web" Accelerated means just that, faster and more intense. 
I believe most any basic degree (not including any field of Doctorates, they need efficient practicum, etc.) can be earned in a year or two as long as you earn each degree in a respectable order and earn it through a high standard curriculum and educator. 
Most universities prolong education, not just for the assurance or sake of a student's adequate education, but for financial gain also. 
Anyone that has been through college can probably relate to what I'm saying. 
When I contacted AIU, the first thing they asked was did I have at least an Associates to apply, becasue at first they thought I wanted a Bachelors. 
Although I have a higher degree, it was already initialized if I didn't have an Associates I couldn't apply for a Bachelors. 
Now, I don't know about you, but most colleges online or traditional institutions don't do this. 
This could be a good or bad thing. 
Some will see it as holding a higher stander of entry into an educational institution and some will see it as bank robbery. 
Beware though, sometimes this is used in order to make more money from innocent first-time students that really desire a Bachelors Degree, but not yet have the Associate level completed. 
This could be an attempted tactic used in marketing to ultimately make more money overall from an individual student if they decide to continue their Bachelors after gaining their Associates through the same institution, because of strong encouragement through faculty and administration. 
Last but not least, here is a link to check out some REAL TRUTHS about US Department higher learning institutions. 
If you ever have a question about any school, investigate it here http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/. 
Keep in mind that institutions aren't obligated to have a listing with the U S Department of Education, but it is wise to choose any school that is. 
This will help you to achieve more from future employers and educational opportunities. 
I apologize for any typographical errors. 
My time was very limited to make this post. 
I think this site has its purpose. 
It does encourage people to investigate universities before applying. 
Everyone keep sharing thoughts and using your own abilities and minds to select the right institution regarding your own individual preferences and expectations.

		I took classes for a year at UMUC Online. 
The teachers were awesome. 
The best i have experienced in online classes. 
The financial aid office was always messing things up though, and the amount of work involved in some of the classes was well above what i have experienced elsewhere, even in the regular classroom setting.

		For a program that serves a lot of military personnel, I didn't find degree programs that supported my military career. 
Telephone calls and e-mail to Maryland personnel were not responded to. 
That telephone just rang and rang and rang. 
Other universities offered better choices in terms of majors, and transfer credit for military personnel. 
So, eventually I went with another program. 
I think one can only suck it up and drive on for so long before getting fed up and moving on. 
Sorry UMUC, you don't provide quality services for the money you expect.

		I really do not see where the people who bash this school so badly are coming from. 
I've attended Devry in IL for almost a year and a half, and my experience has been very good.


Every one of my professors has had a masters degree or higher, years of experience in the field related to the course material, and they have all been very personable and approachable. 
The class sizes are small to medium, and the material covered is practical and relevant. 
Put simply, the tools for receiving a great education are there, and the environment is excellent.


There is a lot of material covered in each class, and therefor a lot of work must be done to take full advantage of the time spent. 
With that said the professors (in my experience) do show compassion and give a lot of open book tests. 
This does not however make for an easy A. People who do not do the work still struggle and receive bad grades.


My summary of the school is that you get what you put in, and there is ample opportunity to get a lot out. 
However some people are able to coast by and then ruin it for everyone else after their dumb asses enter the workforce. 
Now I find myself in the difficult situation of enjoying my school, but fearing a sub-par reputation may hamper my ambitions. 
So at the moment I am reluctantly weighing my options for transferring to a different school.

		I've had a very positive experience with UoP. 
You have to want your degree to endure the sometimes grueling assignments. 
It's a great learning environment but not for the weak. 
I encourage anyone who is ready to finish their degree to try it. 
Like with most things in life, you will find what you are looking for if you try hard enough. 
If you choose to find negativity, you will and vice versa.

		I am currently attending Western International University. 
Western International University is a branch of University Of Phoenix Online. 
I have been attending this university for 6 months now and have had a wonderful experience. 
I attended Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, which is a great school, but it was extremely difficult to find time in my busy schedule to attend class. 
It was a 25-minute drive, if you didn't hit traffic. 
Finding parking was a challenge and I was tired all of the time. 
Having a career and attending school full time is overwhelming. 
I did not take the easy way out. 
I just explored my options. 
The option to go to school when I want while obtaining an accredited degree was unimaginable; however, available. 
Transferring from ODU to University of Phoenix Online was the best thing I have ever done. 
It is very challenging. 
One must have self-discipline to attend this university. 
There is a lot of writing and researching involved. 
It is not easy whatsoever; however, it is convenient. 
Regarding financial aid, enrollment, and academic counselors, there have been no issues. 
Financial aid is something that you pretty much take care of yourself through the FAFSA website. 
The financial aid counselors are just there for guidance. 
My enrollment counselor explained the positives and negatives of the university. 
She explained, "This is not for everyone". 
She was very honest and helpful. 
She did not bribe me with her words as some have stated. 
My academic counselor was too good. 
Honestly, he called too much. 
I felt like I couldn't keep up with him. 
I'm sure that some of you have had bad experiences as with anyone, anywhere. 
For example, department stores, car dealerships, airlines, etc. 
Just because one employee misrepresents a company, doesn't mean you should bad mouth it. 
Everyone deserves a second chance.

		## URL: http://www.epinions.com/webs-review-36E7-AB704A5-39C11E74-prod1.
## Topic: Join a List!!.

## Score: 5.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            I was addicted to the internet from the moment I got online using AOL in December of 1996. 
I would log on and immediately go into chat rooms, especially ones pertaining to being a mom. 
At that time my daughter was only 13 months old, and I was a stay at home mom. 
It was really nice to chat with other mothers and make a connection with ladies in similar positions as I. 


Some time after that, probably in late 1997 I discovered Egroups, at that time it was called Onelist. 
Egroups/Onelist is a site for email lists. 
There are hundreds, actually thousands of categories and topics to choose from. 
Everything you can think of, including religion, pets, parenting (even goes as far as parenting for children born in certain years) and jobs, just to name a few.


I started out on a list for 1995 Children (children born in the year 1995) and it was a wonderful way to share ideas and just chat with other women. 
I quickly learned to prefer the email list over chat rooms for several reasons.

1. 
With chat rooms, you never know who is going to be in the room with you. 
On email lists the members generally stay the same. 
People do come and go, but many will remain on the list for long periods of time. 
You get to know them on a more personal level and develop real friendships with them. 

2. 
To participate on email lists, all you have to do is send an email to the group you are subscribed to and the email goes to all members of that list. 
Some people will answer right away, while others may take several hours or even days. 
A discussion or laughs is easily shared and if someone isn't online at the time, you won't miss anything. 
Email lists are alot more convenient than chat rooms.

3. 
The security on an email list can be much better than in a chat room. 
Usually the "owner" or Moderator of an email list will check out a person before approving their membership. 
Yes, occasionally you do get an oddball, or a guy (if you happen to belong to an all womens group)....but they are found and weeded out pretty quickly.


I have now been with one particular email list for 2 years this October. 
Many of the same women have been members as long as I have. 
We have really gotten to know each other in those 2 years. 
I have met some wonderful ladies and built a great network of support. 
We share alot of ourselves through this list and it is so nice to know you aren't alone!


The Egroups website is very easy to navigate. 
It is a free service and all you have to do is register in order to be eligible to use the service. 
Searching for a group you are interested in is very simple and a search on a key word will usually generate hundreds of choices. 
You can choose from lists which are geared towards all audiences (10+) or if you prefer adults only (21+). 
Occasionally the email runs a little slow and it seems to have become intermittent since they merged with Yahoo!


I highly recommend Egroups. 
This service has proven to be a large part of my day to day life. 
I would really miss these ladies whom I have become close to if I were to leave.

		My Master's in Information Technology at UMUC stings as one of the great bad investments of my life. 
The whole experience was so utterly fraudulent on so many levels. 
But I was already invested in the third semester before I could no longer dismiss as flukes my astoundingly incompetent or apathetic professors. 
Egregious plagiarism was the name of the game: Professors regularly regurgitate curricula and lectures from prior semesters. 
Students merely copy and paste discussion threads into their own submissions, knowing their instructors award grades based on automated metrics like word count. 
Power Point is considered an acceptable format for term papers! 
No thesis required for a Masters degree. 
And the anonymity of online study, already a huge obstacle to an edifying experience, is I believe actively promoted by UMUC for the simple reason that its impossible to criticize when you cant organize. 
I recall one class in which our instructor logged in (and this is not an exaggeration) twice during the semester: once to greet everyone and once to collect our final exams. 
Four or five of us managed to overcome the anonymity of our chat rooms to take action: a formal letter to the administration which went totally unanswered. 
I guess what I find most depressing is the thought of people pursuing their undergraduate degrees at UMUC. 
Having gone to a traditional University for my Bachelor's, I simply cannot imagine a graduate of UMUC's Web Tycho interface having experienced anything substantive. 
And it may sound elitist, but it just seems depressing to think of tens of thousands (a href=http://www.umuc.edu/ip/umucfacts_02.html) of people walking around, thinking they've learned anything more than how to manipulate a web interface. 
That UMUC is accredited raises some serious questions about the state of academia and the trend towards distance education. 
And I do suspect that these problems are not unique to UMUC. 
High-bandwidth distance education, through which real bonds, expectations and communication can take place, might work some day. 
But the current state of distance education is just too shallow, but promoted by an educational system too strapped for cash and a community of working adults, too strapped for time. 
UMUC's WebTycho interface is at best a pretend classroom with a few clever javascripts and java applets to entertain you while you wait months for feedback on that paper you're now starting to feel embarrassed for having taken so seriously. 
You'll learn though, and by the end of your program, you'll find you needn't even bother buying the textbooks and you can get by with a couple manic hours of copying and pasting once or twice a semester. 
Had an interview recently in which my interviewer said: UMUC, yeah - I've heard of them. 
I see their ads on the metro all the time. 
-but, I mean, is that even a real degree? 
Have noticed some others here are giving UMUC 4 or 5 stars - Don't believe them: This is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes if ever there was one! 
I don't even bother to list it on my resume anymore.

		One of the worst things about Capella is that it doesn't integrate technology into its courses. 
There are no Power Point slides, no telecourses, no video feeds or rental tapes, etc. 
In fact, all you can expect to do at Capella is read and write (in the traditional, visually unappealing, and very boring way). 
There is actually very little teaching going on, except for what you are teaching yourself through your own efforts (reading and writing). 
You can expect to learn more from your fellow classmates than any instructor teaching at Capella. 
At least that has been my experience and I have taken 6 classes with 6 different instructors. 
Whatever you choose to write about in your discussion posts is fine. 
There are no corrections in your thought process or interpretations because there is no teaching going on. 
They make you use APA but it doesn't matter. 
Why? 
Because if you get your grammar and punctuation wrong, no one bothers to correct it. 
Again, there is no teaching going on. 
I just don't understand why quality instruction can't be provided by a university with no actual campus and high tuition rates. 
Can't somebody please summarize and highlight the important points in my text through, say for example, a slide presentation? 
How nice the staff and administration are is secondary to getting a proper and useful education. 
Don't you think?

		University of Phoenix is a complete waste of time and money. 
The online experience is like no other! 
They misrepresent their programs and then once enrolled, they change midstream. 
When enrolling for the program I was told that I needed to log into the computer 3 out of 7 days, but once classes started it was 5 out of 7. This may not sound like a big deal for some, but most people in a MBA distance/online program are there as more of a convienence. 
I have found that it is easier to sit in a live class 1 night a week oppossed to being online nearly every day. 
Another HUGE turnoff was the group work. 
Instructors paired the class into teams and assigned papers, projects and power point presentations. 
Sounds simple, but when one member of the team does not do their share...everyone suffers! 
I am all for being a team player, but not when it comes to my education. 
I believe this is something and individual needs to achieve on their own! 
STUDENTS BEWARE!!!!!

## Topic: All About Egroups .
## Score: 4.0.
## Recommended: Yes.

            
            
            
            Oh, all right, I admit it: I'm a sucker for email lists. 


Egroups is one of my favorite websites for that reason. 
I have several email addresses - most of them on Juno because AOL limits the number of screen names one can have - and I am registered with Egroups at each one of these addresses.


I belong to transplant-related Egroups on one Juno account, conspiracy-related and psychic-related email lists on another, and so forth. 
The variety of lists offered by Egroups is just that wide.


The major problem one might have with Egroups is that it is owned by Yahoo!
, notorious for doing all sorts of seemingly nasty things to authors of email. 
Some of my email lists do hiccup occasionally, and when Yahoo! 
has taken over other web services and attempted to impose its way of doing things on seemingly unsuspecting customers, they have successfully defended their rights and gotten Yahoo! 
to back down from some of their more - shall we say, interesting policies. 
It remains to be seen what will happen with Egroups because it has only recently been bought out by Yahoo!. 


I recommend this service highly, due to the variety of email lists it offers and the ease with which one can set up an email list on it.

            Ever want to send one email to everyone at the same time to save time? 
Ever wanted to start a news flash email about your favorite music group? 
Ever wanted to have your whole family on one mailing list so you can trade stories to all of them at one time? 

Ever just wanted to start a joke email that goes out once a week? 
Well with Egroups you can do all that and much more! 
I have seen many uses for Egroups such as photo trading with your family and friends, a music mail list, well just about any kind of email list you can think of! 
With Egroups, you can send photos or store them in the files page. 

You can start polls with the polls item and update everyone about them with ONE email! 
There is also a database that you can set up anyway you like! 
Egroups is so easy that anyone that can work regular email can run it! 
You just go to www.egroups.com set it up the way you like with a few questions, then give the link out to everyone you would like to join! 

You can even make it a private club! 
I find it to be the most compromising system to use if you ever start a website and want a mailing list or even work in an office and want to send out lunch meeting announcements! 
It's perfect for anyone of any age. 
Including the email you can choose to let every member be able to send out emails or just you! 

You have the polls you can set up to end when you want and you can choose to let others see the tallies or wait until you choose to let them know when you want them to know! 

You have a calendar you can post dates of event on, the database you can use to chart any statistics you wish, the file cabinet to hold pictures and text files and so much more! 
If you like to send mails or run online news letters this is a must! 
Oh also so you don't get complaints, either keep your mails to a minimum, just allow the owner of the mailing list to send emails or let everyone know that they are free to un-subscribe anytime and that it's on the front page how to! 
But I'm sure if you have a great topic everyone will love it! 
But out of all the email systems this is the best by far!

		I am currently attending CTU online and am about to finish my ASIT. 
CTU is a for profit school so of course their recruiters are going to try really hard to get you to attend. 
After going through the initial process which took about a month, it has been a wonderful experience ever since. 
The lower division courses weren't terribly challenging; however later core classes have been challenging and full of real world knowledge. 
I am extremely happy with my instructors at CTU. 
The IT instructors have all been amazing mentors. 
They all hold degrees and have field experience. 
CTU helped me land the job that I have right now as Help Desk Administrator. 
I am thinking about finishing my BSIT on campus because I would like more hands on experience. 
Two out of the three colleges that I went to said that they would accept the credits that I earned at CTU online. 
I think that speaks for itself.


Online schooling isn't for everyone. 
You need to be able to manage your time effectively. 
A lot of students have problems with this. 
If this is your case, I suggest going to on campus school.


If you've never attended CTU, please do not talk bad about it. 
They are regional accredited. 
Many of us do not have the option of going to school full on campus. 
CTU online is a great alternative. 
You will get what you put into it. 
Online schooling has become more prevalent today and is accepted and practiced by many universities.

		I am currently a student at UoP, and for every post on here there are some truth to them. 
However, that said, I am approaching my last year in my BSB/ Marketing program. 
I have applied for jobs as a student of UoP and gotten calls and interviews. 
Yes there are slackers in the learning teams. 
Name me one team environment without slackers. 
I work damn hard for my grades and people who are on my team who chose not to work are shown the door. 
I lay down the law. 
Period!! I am not paying $1300 for a course to have some semi-literate, low self-esteem person affect my grade. 
UoP has to clean up its act and stop admitting everybody and their grand mama. 
They have to establish minimum standards and maintain them. 
I have had classes with students who are reading at elementary school level and I was so freaking embarrassed. 
I have had conversations with faculty who have confided their frustrations with the quality of the students. 
Certainly I have been tempted to transfer to a cheaper school with better reputation, but my bills got to be paid plus I keep getting promotion after promotion because I have applied the knowledge I have learned in my current profession. 
So to all the nay sayers..it is not Yale or Columbia...it is UoP and it has a place. 
UoP is a departure from tradition and people are always scared of change. 
I embrace change and will use the positive and change the negative. 
Over to the Apollo to make the next moves.
